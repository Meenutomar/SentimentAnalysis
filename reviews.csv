,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!",Style Name: Processor OnlyVerified Purchase,Anish Roy,Reviewed in India on 28 June 2022,True,[]
,"I have paired this processor with Asus Prime Z690A motherboard and 32G 5200Mhz DDR5 ram. My usage is mostly for Adobe suite for 4K video rendering & photoediting (without dedicated eGPU) and ocassonal AAA title gaming like GTA5, Battlefield, Cpunk,etc.
The processor works like a charm for rendering and Games upto 75Hz in 1080p ultra setting.

I was wrong...
This cpu is a monster in my eyes. Running with 32GB of ram (ddr4) and matched with the RTX 4070 GPU being cooled by the Artic Liquid Freezer ii, there is nothing stopping this from performing to its max.

,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.

Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...

If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.

TL:DR
Upgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.
Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.
Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)

Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!

Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).

,"This is my first intel build coming from past AMD builds (Ryzen, FX, Athlon, Phenom). I am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this CPU with instructions followed, this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least 2026. I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all. If you have the extra 50-60$ go with the i9 i should have done that.

So I recently decided to upgrade my gaming rig, and after extensive research, I made the bold choice to order the Intel Core i7-12700K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 12 Cores.

Whether I'm playing graphically demanding AAA titles or indulging in intense multitasking, this processor effortlessly handles it all. And what's even better is that it comes with integrated graphics, meaning I didn't have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card, yet. The integrated Graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups.

,"It's pretty good value for money (as far as intel CPUs are concerned...) for a 12th gen CPU, but if you're looking for the BETTER value get the i5-13600K which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen CPU. The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable.",Style Name: Processor OnlyVerified Purchase,Sai,Reviewed in Canada on 5 August 2023,True,[]

,"The i7-12700K is in the top 5 for gaming CPUs right now. AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips.

If you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows:
1. i9-13900k
2. i7-13700k
3. i9-12900k
4. i5-13600k
5. i7-12700k

This chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison.

In conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper. Higher end 12th gen Intel motherboards can be flashed in the BiOS to take 13th gen CPUs too, but do your research on those before going that route.

,"It's been roughly 6-7 years since I last build my gaming computer. Upgrading to this has been more than significant. As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog.

Some things to consider before purchasing:
1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4.
2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead.
3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible.

And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling.

,"INTRO
Come è giusto che sia, anziché comprare portatilini e preassemblati, un vero nerd si costruisce il computer da solo, e oltre a questo, condivide la sua esperienza nell'antica arte del PC Building anche con amici e parenti. Mio fratello aveva necessità di utilizzare un computer, e immaginando la tristezza di vederlo con un portatile, un preassemblato o ancora peggio con un Mac, ho pensato di costruirgli un computerino su misura. E comunque, quale modo migliore di convertire qualcuno al PC Gaming se non con un computer assemblato con tanto amore fraterno?

Ho deciso quindi di scegliere questo processore perché trattandosi di una build sostanzialmente da utilizzo scolastico + gaming, e con un budget relativamente limitato (ok l'amore fraterno e tutto ma non esageriamo), mi sembrava il miglior compromesso tra prestazioni e qualità. Alla fine il venditore mi ha spedito il 12400F, ma io volevo il 12400, quindi ho fatto il reso, e ho comprato il 12500 che comunque è identico a parte la GPU integrata e frequenze un pelino più alte, quindi lo posso recensire lo stesso visto che sostanzialmente sono lo stesso processore.

Si tratta di un processore da 6 core e 12 thread, che non ha i fantomatici E-cores delle serie più costose (per sempio, il 12600 ha 6P-Core come questo più 4E-Core che aiutano nelle operazioni in background, specialmente se usate Windows 11), a una frequenza di 2.5 Ghz con un boost fino a 4.4Ghz se le temperature, il workload, e la vostra scheda madre lo permettono.
Un processore di questo tipo eccelle nel gaming, ma non fa schifo neanche nelle operazioni più complicate, infatti questo processore si comporta benissimo anche nel video editing con Adobe Premiere.

L'ho abbinato a una RTX3060 12G della Gigabyte e a 32Gb di DDR4 a 3200Mhz, il tutto su una Asus B660M-A Prime.

PERFORMANCE E TEMPERATURE
Come dicevo prima, si tratta di un processore di fascia media particolarmente portato per il gaming, ma che gestisce senza intoppi anche le operazioni più ""professionali"". L'architettura di questi processori Intel di dodicesima generazione, dopo un'undicesima generazione abbastanza deludente, è eccellente.
Senza dare i numeri con benchmark e altre cose poco comprensibili, vi posso dire che nel gaming si comporta allo stesso livello del buon vecchio Ryzen 5 5600X, senza dubbio il miglior processore di fascia media assieme a questo. Non credo avrete problemi in gaming o produttività utilizzando questo processore, ammesso che il resto dell'hardware sia all'altezza.
Io lo utilizzo con delle banali DDR4 a 3200Mhz, quindi come performance siamo simili al 5600X che avevo su una mia build dell'anno scorso, se invece lo abbinate a delle DDR5 un po' serie può sicuramente superarlo anche se di poco.
In ogni caso, nel gaming si comporta benissimo, specialmente se abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria (come la mia RTX3060). Non ho notato colli di bottiglia, specialmente nel caso di questa build, che sarà usata con un monitor ""solo"" 1080p.

Per quanto riguarda le temperature, si tratta di una CPU abbastanza tranquilla con un TDP di solo 65W. Al momento non ho un dissipatore, perché non mi è arrivato, quindi sto usando il dissipatore stock incluso nella confezione. Mi aspettavo facesse pena, invece è decisamente accettabile. Le temperature non superano i 70C in gaming, anche con giochi pesanti, mentre invece sfruttandola al massimo con un Cinebench, non supera gli 80C, che è accettabile e ampiamente sotto la soglia di throttling di 100C. Anche il rumore della ventolina originale è abbastanza contenuto, quindi boh, magari lo tengo con il dissipatore stock. Sicuramente comunque il mio case, un NZXT con 4 ventole aggiuntive, aiuta non poco, oltre a questo non mi fidavo del velo di pasta termica preapplicata, e ci ho messo la mia fidata Gelid GC Extreme, perché per un processore da 65W con il dissi stock sicuramente è necessaria una pasta termica di livello Extreme.

VERSIONE F O NON F? TRAY O BOX? GPU INTEGRATA?
La differenza tra le due versioni sta nella disponibilità della GPU integrata. La versione F non la include, e generalmente costa un po' meno. A seconda della differenza di prezzo, valutate se prendere una o l'altra. Io non sono un fan delle GPU integrate Intel e cerco sempre quando possibile di abbinare una GPU dedicata, anche se scarsissima. In questo caso ho la RTX3060 che è una buona scheda da gaming, quindi perché ho voluto prendere il processore con la GPU integrata? Perché con certi programmi che supportano la tecnologia Intel Quicksync, la GPU integrata non sta lì a dormire ma viene utilizzata attivamente per l'encoding video o per altre operazioni, come per esempio la timeline in Premiere. Il fratellino utilizza Adobe Premiere che può sfruttare questa tecnologia, ma anche altri programmi di video editing o streaming la usano, come per esempio OBS Studio, che può sfruttare l'encoder video della GPU integrata per strimmare, lasciando libera la GPU dedicata per il gioco.

In ogni caso, la GPU Integrata è la solita Intel UHD, sul 12400 è la UHD 730, sul 12500 la 770. Non l'ho testata molto nel gaming, ma comunque non aspettatevi chissà cosa. La potenza di questa è simile alle entry level dedicate sui portatili di qualche anno fa come la 930M o giù di lì, quindi va bene per giochi leggeri. In ogni caso, non ha problemi di sorta quando si tratta di visualizzare video o immagini 3D non particolarmente complesse, regge senza problemi i video in 4k su youtube o giochini retro ed emulatori vari.

Per quanto riguarda altre nomenclature criptiche, a volte vediamo Tray o Box, la differenza tra le due è la presenza del dissipatore nella versione Box. Come dicevo sopra, il dissipatore è scarso ma per una CPU come questa è sufficiente. Se invece il dissi non vi serve, prendete la versione Tray.

PRENDO IL 12400, 12500 O 12600?
Secondo me, tra questi tre il migliore è il 12400 e vi spiego anche il perché.
Il 12400 e il 12500 sono fratelli, mentre il 12600 è a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore.
Partiamo dal 12500, questo processore ha la stessa base del 12400 ma con frequenze di base e di boost poco più alte, oltre che una gpu integrata leggermente più potente (ovvero la Intel UHD 770 contro la 730 del 12400). Le frequenze più alte in buona sostanza si traducono in un miglioramento statico in media del 5%, di più o di meno a seconda del workload, ma praticamente mai sopra il 10%. La GPU integrata è di poco più potente, ma si tratta sempre di un'integrata scarsissima poco adatta per il gaming a prescindere. Se la differenza di prezzo fosse di una decina di euro ci potrebbe anche stare, ma onestamente non mi viene in mente nessuna ragione per la quale il 12500 merita di esistere a quasi 100€ in più. Evitatelo. Io l'ho comprato solo perché mi serviva di fretta e il venditore ha sbagliato a inviarmi il 12400F anziché il 12400. Altrimenti non l'avrei mai comprato.

Il 12600 invece è su un altro campo da gioco, ed è a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore. Come dicevo all'inizio, oltre ai 6 P-Core il 12600 ha 4 E-Core, oltre che frequenze più alte, e la versione K se volete overcloccare. Per il prezzo di quasi 150€ sopra al 12400, potrebbe anche starci se rientra nel vostro budget e fate multitasking intenso o molte operazioni di rendering. Nel gaming sono praticamente uguali, la differenza tra i due si percepisce a framerate elevati e risoluzioni basse, in giochi AAA magari in 4k sarete limitati dalla GPU nella maggior parte dei casi. In ogni caso, se si vuole assemblare un PC con un budget più alto del mio e magari abbinato ad una GPU più potente della mia 3060, potrebbe valerne la pena, anche solo per la presenza degli E-Cores.

Comunque, ritengo che il 12400 sia lo sweet spot, da considerare per qualunque PC di fascia media, valutando eventualmente un upgrade tra qualche anno alla generazione 13xxx quando caleranno i prezzi.

CONCLUSIONE
Che dire, il 12400 è una CPU di tutto rispetto, ad un prezzo molto conveniente tra l'altro. È eccellente in una build da gaming di fascia media, abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria, e non fatica nemmeno nei programmi di grafica professionali (utilizzati a livello amatoriale o scolastico).

Sicuramente non vi sto dicendo niente di nuovo, ma lo consiglio appieno per build di fascia media e budget contenuto.",Pattern Name: ProcessorVerified Purchase,MRK,Reviewed in Italy on 6 March 2023,True,[]

Für den Preis gibt es in Sachen gaming nichts zu meckern ich denke die CPU richtet sich durch die fehlende igpu auch an solche.

1 keine igpu ohne eine eigene Grafikkarte kein Bild
2 Boxed Kühler kann man sofort entsorgen (Trotz angegebener 65watt) mit Boxed Kühler über 80 Grad

Dann zu den Pluspunkten

- Leistung für Grade einmal 119€ erhält man ein CPU mit dem man eigentliche jegliches Spiel über der 60 FPS Marke daddeln kann.

-Temparaturen auch wen der Boxed Kühler nicht zu gebrauchen ist läst sich die CPU auch unter Volllast mit einem normalen Luft Kühler (20€) bei 50 bis 52 Grad halten was absolut top ist .

Es gibt einfach für diesen Preis nichts zu meckern und jeder 1080p Spieler bis 144Hertz Sollte seine Freude mit der CPU haben.

Non credo comunque che possa cambiare più di tanto in gaming, visti parecchi video comparativi anche con i7 ed i9 della stessa serie e gli fps sono praticamente gli stessi.. il che lascia parecchi quesiti sul senso o meno di spendere 3 volte tanto per ottenere poco o niente in più, sempre restando in ambito gaming, nella produttività sicuramente processori con più threads faranno la differenza.",Pattern Name: ProcessorVerified Purchase,Alessandro,Reviewed in Italy on 26 March 2024,True,[]

- System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in “eco” mode in my motherboard’s settings
- Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads
- Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirector

Note that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).

If you don’t need a built-in GPU, consider the i7-13700KF; the built-in GPU is nice to have but not always worth the premium. If you also don’t plan to overclock, consider the i7-13700F.",Pattern Name: Core i7 ProcessorVerified Purchase,RubberCheese,Reviewed in Canada on 24 July 2023,True,[]

,"In general - all mentioned in this review products are as described and working as described. Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off). Instead of reviewing item by item I decided to write one review for all products used for one specific PC build. The purpose of this PC build - fancy compact gaming system.
Items used in this build:
--
Item 1) OCPC Mini ITX Case, Hydra Italy Mini ITX PC Case, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BK6D77DG/
Very good case – compact, cool looking and efficient. The black color is the only variant I found on Amazon. With only cooling from top-down CPU cooler, the i7-13700K based system passed the stress test very well. Riser cable is not included – actually the riser cable for GPU orientation as shown on Amazon item photo does not exist. In order to build the system as shown, I bought a flexible riser cable (Item #2) and twisted it to 180°. Another simpler solution is to install GPU upside down as presented by other reviewers on Amazon.
--
Item 2) EZDIY-FAB PCIE 4.0 16x Extreme High Speed Flexible Riser Cable PCI Express Port GPU Extension Card-Dual Reverse Connector for ITX [21cm]. Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09S5DW3RX/
-Does the job - exactly what I need for the project. Note: During system build I have to remove the bracket from the cable male connector and install it back after passing cable through the case hole.
--
Item 3) Power supply: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold Full Modular, 750W, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LP7B7FM/
- Works as supposed to. PSU had a noticeable burning smell for about 5 days, considering this is normal for a new PSU. If you want to build more powerful gaming system, I recommend the PCIe 5.0 ready 850W SFX PSU, something like ARESGAME GL850 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHDS4J33/
SFX-L PSU will work in Hydra Mini as well, but cable management will be tougher.
--
Item 4) CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BCF57FL5/
- Good CPU, working well in gaming.
--
Item 5) Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR8TVLPL/
- Working as described, nice looking MB. Thank you, ASUS - now ROG motherboards have the Memtest86+ built in BIOS. This very helpful feature allows PC builders to check memory before operating system installation and prevent blue screens and failures during OS install and system use in case of defective memory.
In my case originally ordered CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1R95SPW/) was defective. Both memory modules came to life and showed ok in BIOS but Memtest86+ got errors. I did test modules one by one in the same memory slot and found out that one of the modules is the cause of the failures. Returned the defective memory and bought another from a different brand (Item #6). ASUS ROG Motherboard chosen for the look. In my opinion the best Intel (or may be overall) mini ITX MB on the market is MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ ) I own one and have a very best experience.
--
Item 6) Memory: TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 Ram 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BNTV1945/
-Very good product, works as described, nice looking, recognized by Aura Sync.
--
Item 7) Graphics Card: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCFZMHSM/
- Graphics card work as supposed to, have low power consumption. This GPU was chosen for the look only. Anyway, the presented system can play all modern games well at 1440p. But if you want the very good gaming experience, I will recommend at least RTX 4070 Ti like MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 2X 12G OC. And the very best (talking about built on Hydra Italy Mini Case) will be the system with 850W PCIe 5.0 SFX PSU and:
a)  MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/
b) Intel Core i9-13900KF,  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCFM3CJ4/
c) ASUS ProArt GeForce RTX™ 4080 16GB OC, ( Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75J66C8/). This compact GPU has included Graphics Card Holder which will work with presented builtI own all of these (a,b,c) components packed in another fancy mini ITX case (Phanteks PH-ES217A_BK02 Evolv Shift 2 Air Mini-ITX case, Fabric Side Panels) and they performed superb in games.
--
Item 8) SSD Disks:
8.1) Primary (system): WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X NVMe Gen4 PCIe M.2 2280 WDS200T2X0E, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7CMZ3QH/
8.2) Secondary (backup and media data): Crucial P3 Plus 4TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 CT4000P3PSSD8, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B25M8FXX/
- Very good products, works as described, no problems.
--
Item 9) Antec Power Supply Sleeved Cable, PSU Cables, PSU Extension Cable Kit / 1x24pin ATX / 2x8pin (4+4) EPS / 3X (6+2) pin PCI-E, 30cm Length with Combs, Dual EPS Red Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BN3H2K17/
- Perfect fit for this project, good cables, looks nice.
--
Item 10)
CPU cooler: ID-COOLING IS-67-XT Black 67mm Height Low Profile CPU Cooler, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CFPY9CKZ/
- Good design, keeps i7-13700K adequately cool in open Air PC Case. Mounting for regular size 120mm fan included. Easy installation - just install radiator 1st and mount fan after. ID-COOLING IS-67-XT chosen because of black color. In my opinion DeepCool AN600 Low Profile CPU Cooler (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P8ZPWT/) has a little bit better cooling performance (I have one in a very compact Flex ATX build).
--
Item 11) EZDIY-FAB Moonlight 120mm RGB PWM Case Fan, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8T79QY/
Good, quiet and nice-looking fan. Actually, it is a leftover piece from a 9 fans ATX tower system build. If you want to build a similar system with a similar look, I recommend Cooler Master MF120 Halo² Fan Duo-Ring ARGB (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWKZGYXJ/). This fan has a similar look but has better airflow / air pressure.
---
Item 12) 24 Pin RGB Cable Extension Kit (used ARGB strip only), Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN4G7KC/
- The power cable connector to MB too tight - did not go all the way down, afraid to broke the MB if try to apply more force (the regular PSU cable fits perfect). Connector to PSU too tight as well, but was able to connect all the way down. Actually, in reality the system with this cable does not look good (too much RGB). Did use ARGB strip only for decoration purposes on the GPU side.
--
Item 13) Thermal Paste: ARCTIC MX-6. Optional - I have a very good experience using this thermal paste brand and always using it for the builds (so thermal paste provided by ID-COOLING was not used). Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VDLH5M6/

This thing is fast. I was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 5.5 Ghz (all p-core) and 4.4 Ghz (all e-cores). I could go higher if I wanted to spend more time on it, but this was a quick overclock. Perfectly stable and runs (relatively)cool with the undervolt. Intel is still my preference for CPUs and I don't foresee that changing, especially with all of the issues I've read regarding AMD chips (boot up issues, crashes, poor multi-core performance).",Pattern Name: Core i7 ProcessorVerified Purchase,Samson Ghirmai,Reviewed in the United States on 16 May 2024,True,[]
,"My previous build had an i7-9700K and after 5 years of abuse, I decided to upgrade in this new build to an i7-13700K and I'm not disappointed. It's a great CPU and is handling everything I throw at it. Stays cool even without a fancy AIO / liquid cooling setup. During the process of installing the CPU on the socket, it fell into place perfectly, but when adjusting the motherboard arm to secure the CPU into the socket, it did feel I had to put a bit more force than I would have thought necessary, but it clicked into place and is running smoothly with no issues. Highly recommended!

,"最上位モデルのCore i9-13900kと悩みましたが、コア数同スペックでピーク性能とワットパフォーマンスが向上しているこちらのCore i7-13700kを選びました。

Z690マザーボードで運用していますがBIOSが対応していれば特に問題なし。最近のマザーボードは電源だけあればBIOS更新可能なので非対応BIOSでも問題ないことが多いです。

デバイスドライバ類は事前に最新に更新（又は新規インストールの場合はダウンロード）しておくことをお勧めします。

CinebenchR23のスコアはマルチ30552、シングル2082。Core i9-12900Kから約1割程度スコアが伸びていて、フルロード時の消費電力は約30Wほど低くなっているのでいい感じです。

10nmと他社の現行製品と比べると２～３世代落ちなプロセスルールで健闘しているとは思いますが、360mm簡易水冷クーラー必須な点はAlder Lakeから変わらず評価が分かれるかと思います。フルロード時のワットパフォーマンスは正直微妙です。

今回取り付けたのはゲーミングPC用なので動画のエンコードなどはさせないため個人的には大満足です。
エンコード処理メインなら大型空冷クーラーで問題なく動作する旧型ですが扱いやすく、価格も安くなっているRyzen 9 5950Xをおすすめします。

,"The highest package temps my CPU gets while running multiple applications is 85 degrees Celsius. And that's only for brief moments. Average 68 - 75 degrees while gaming with high graphics games with youtube running in the background. Maxes at the 253 rated watts for me, which really is fine. Average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles @ 65 watts, which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen. No need to undervolt this CPU, even though you can, you'll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do. During the Cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98 - 100 degrees Celsius, but remember that's absolute max mode, 99% of users will never use this CPU for more than several minutes at. If Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility does not automatically download when installing, definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it. It is easy to use, and you won't regret it. I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to. Most new BIOS's are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway. Do your research on which to use and how.

,"I use this i7-13700K every day for about a year. I have Crucial RAM 64GB Kit (2x32GB) DDR5 4800MT/s CL40 Desktop Memory CT2K32G48C40U5 modules (4 of them), a Corsair RM1000x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply in a Phanteks Enthoo Pro Full Tower Chassis without Window Cases PH-ES614PC_BK in service for about one year as I write this review. For the most part, assembly was very easy. I do video editing, audio editing, streaming, wordprocessing, browsing and email with my setup. I use all of my SATA ports and even have a plug-in eSATA card for more ports. So most of my drive bays are filled. The cpu, dram and everything I have connected to my power supply and motherboard has been rock solid stable, and the case holds in all together. It just works exactly the way I want and have no anomalies. The power supply, motherboard and all components run cool in the case with an i7-13700K CPU, 128 GB of Crucial DDR5-4800 that is clocked at 5200 automatically set by the motherboard itself. My video card is a the very modest ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 HDMI DVI Graphics Card (GT1030-2G-CSM) because I transitioned my ancient setup from MBR to GPT and needed to be able to boot the old system in the new motherboard before updating the Windows 10 Pro config to GPT UEFI and still be able to boot legacy devices. Everything just worked like a Swiss Chronograph.

,"Nice! I upgraded from an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X to this CPU (and the components below) and I couldn't be happier. Everything opens almost instantly, whether it be Windows 11's File Explorer, Edge browser and webpages, and opening files in general. I upgraded primarily because I am a developer, and Visual Studio + Dotfuscator would take almost 8 minutes to compile and obfuscate my largest program on my old build. After upgrading, it now compiles in about 4 mins 45 seconds. The longest part is Dotfuscator, not Visual Studio compiling. Compiling happens in seconds on this setup.

My components:
MSI MPG Z790 Carbon WiFi Gaming Motherboard
Intel Core i7-13700K Desktop Processor (this CPU)
CORSAIR VENGEANCE DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 5600MHz
MSI MPG A1000G PCIE 5 & ATX 3.0 Gaming Power Supply - Full Modular - 80 Plus Gold Certified 1000W
Corsair MP700 2TB PCIe Gen5 x4 NVMe 2.0 M.2 SSD
Cooler Master Hyper 212 Halo White CPU Air Cooler
MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Graphics Card

I don't game much, but there is a noticeable difference loading and playing Cities: Skylines after upgrading, too.

I am very happy with the new PC. Everything runs smoothly, I haven't had a single crash running the XMP Profile in BIOS for my RAM so it runs at full speeds. This CPU blows the Ryzen 7 5800X out of the water. Check out the UserBenchmark: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X vs Intel Core i7-13700K comparison on UserBenchmark's website for details, which is what I did before purchase.

,"After too many years of gaming on an old i7-6700K I finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year. I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...
Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died. Because of that I can easily recommend this CPU and I would definitely order it again.",Pattern Name: Core i7 ProcessorVerified Purchase,A Reader,Reviewed in the United States on 19 June 2023,True,[]

,"I built a new computer during the height of covid (Dummy, I know, right?) and decided on a i9-9900k. I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.

I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).

I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c. And no, I have not done the Contact Plate mod.

TL;DR - This CPU is blazing fast, and if your current processor is a few years old it may very well be worth the upgrade. I don't claim to be Steve from Gamers Nexus, or a pro CPU tester - but I can tell you that this thing is amazing, and will serve you well for years to come.",Pattern Name: Core i7 ProcessorVerified Purchase,Seth Magoon,Reviewed in the United States on 1 February 2023,True,[]

,"The i7-13700K has i7-12900K performance at an i7 range price range. Please note I used an older Z690 EVGA Classified Board. I was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new CPU yet. I suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboard’s vendor manual. The installation was incredibly easy, and I booted the BIOS after the BIOS update without any problem. I had hit 5 GHz on the CPU without overclocking. It also supported 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM without any issues after enabling XMP. The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMD’s expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intel’s 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere. This CPU runs cool with a 360 mm AIO and a high airflow case (around 30-36 C idle temperature for me).

Currently, my idle temps are around 41c and at 100% utilization, temps average around 60-70 with a quick peak of 95. I dont personally like to overclock for my own reasons, but I did do some overclocking on this for testing and everything worked great with what I did. 13th Gen blows away 12th gen.

As for gaming, it'll run many older games at a high FPS even without any help from a GPU, and it handles modern titles without any problems, too.

,"the i7 11700K 11th gen sits in between the well reviewed i5 and the poorly priced i9 11900k. I think at this price (I got it at pre-launch sale of $399) it's a good product. It's cheaper than the 5800X, performs very close to it and is a lot more fun to Overclock. Rocket Lake (11th gen) supports specific core overclocks to dial in ratios for the two best cores and other less hot cores. It also can take a tad bit more voltage than skylake++++ (1.45V load voltage supposedly safe according to Reddit AMA) although running at slightly lower all core clocks than comet lake with improved IPC. This actually seems to run slightly cooler for me but power draw can be pretty nuts on stress tests. Gaming load is not bad at all I was seeing around 100w on Horizon Zero Dawn.
Unless you want the highest overclocks, the i7 can still get you pretty close or above the stock clocks of the i9 with manual tuning without the price premium and similar real world performance. Coming from the i9-10900k, the gaming FPS is pretty similar at UW 1440p, but rocket lake seems much more stable with overclocking - as in you get watch dog BSOD errors or you don’t - not the WHEA stuff. The RAM gear stuff is a little overblown, the performance penalty of running 1:2 is not as bad as what you see on Ryzen. You can run very high speed ram 4800+ and looser timings and get a ton of performance from these chips. I'm an enthusiast and I've had Ryzen and Intel systems and I just enjoy tuning Intel CPUs.

Value is just OK. It is a bit lower than the 12th gen counterpart, and continually getting a bit cheaper all the time, but it is still close enough in price that if you CAN go with a 12th gen intel build, I would have just gone that route (I was pretty much limited with my choice of mobo, so i could only go as high as 11th gen intel and gen3 m.2).

Any way I am running it with an RX 560 4GB right now on my UHD 52"" TV on low settings unless video cards come back down to reasonable prices again & it works fine for the games I play.

,"May 2021 (sometime)- I decided the processor (I don't recommend you do that), it required a oven and a lot of patience.

April 12, 2021-for some reason my cpu is now shooting up to 100C the moment I do a stress test (within less than 2 seconds) causing it to throttle tremendously. I have changed nothing. I reseated my cooler thinking maybe it had shifted and that still didn't fix it. I am going to check through everything today, maybe something changed in my bios for some reason.

,"So far so good. This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset. I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas. I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.

In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games

**Update**

I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling! As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset. If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes. So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.

If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled. But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.

The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be. Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance. My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.

,"I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal. I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card. I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage. Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate. Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again. This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.

I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.

I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.

I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessor

,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.

For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—

Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.

When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.

The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...

Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.

As of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.

The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...

We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""

Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees. Just having fun, do what you love!

I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!

Note:
Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.

,"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use. After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result. I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v. I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE. this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully. It basically throttles the chip.

I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out. Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine. I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive. It does run HOT even with water cooling. IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5. Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.

Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use. Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing. HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300. So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.

System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core. Disabled in BIOS now.
Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080ti

So the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.

,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.

i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.

ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.

yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.

here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores

1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black
2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)
3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)
4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)
5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)
6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)
7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.

then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!

so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was 2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.

i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.

personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(",Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i9-14900KVerified Purchase,JZ the reviewer,Reviewed in the United States on 11 February 2024,True,[]
,"This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is why
Even if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.
I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZ
I get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.
I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.
Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .
Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .

,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.!
Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly.
Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build.
The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims.
With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive.
It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i9-14900KVerified Purchase,Eric E.,Reviewed in the United States on 19 March 2024,True,[]

,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to i9-14900K . It's OK but I can't rave over it. It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.

The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K. For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen. Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K. Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful. I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.

I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures. Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better. Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C). I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing. A second one became slightly flaky.

I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display. But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me. If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays. IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.

The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night. On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.

The I9 14900k is a beast and runs hot. While doing benchmarks, a few Pcores would hit 100c while others would hit 92c. Ecores was about 87c and low of 83c on 4.3Ghz all Pcore and 4.2Ghz all Ecore. Offset voltage was at 0.3. After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore.

,"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.

I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)

If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator.

One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap.

He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.

The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.

While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller.

,"I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother. It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag.

,"Core i5-4590からの乗り換えです。
ベンチマーク走らせたり最高負荷で動かしたことはないので通常使用でのレビューとなります。

今回は以下のような構成で組んでみました。

CPU: Core i7-10700K
MB: ASUS TUF GAMING Z490 PLUS
Cooler: 風魔 弐（FUMA2）
グリス: SMZ-01R
GPU: MSI GeForce GTX 1070 ARMOR 8G OC (4590からの移設)
MEM: ADATA DDR4-2666 16GB x 2
SSD: WD Blue SN550 1TB NVMe
電源: Cobra Power 800W

[総評]
ゲームにおいても開発作業においても十分以上の性能を発揮してくれます。
価格も購入当初は56,000円と高めでしたが、最近49,000円くらいまで落ち着いてきたみたいなので、今から組むのなら10700K一択ですね。
Comet Lake-Sよりハイパースレッディングテクノロジーが解禁されたためわざわざ数千～1万渋ってまでCoffee Lake以前のi7を買う意味があまり感じられないのが正直なところ。
値段的な意味でしぶるならi5-10600Kを視野にいれるほうがコスパはいいと思います。

[処理性能]
ゲーム性能はGPU性能がものを言いますが、タイトルによってはCPUもかなり食うので性能が低いとボトルネックとなることがあります。
4590ではGTA Vの中画質程度でCPU 100%張り付きで大体40-60FPSを行き来していたのが10700Kでは60FPSを常に維持できました。
Dying Lightもやりましたが、常に60FPS維持できた上に使用率は20%行ってたかな？程度。(GTA Vも含めて)
CPUに余裕があれば複数のゲームを同時起動することも可能なので、ネトゲしながらGTA Vやったりなんてことも性能的には余裕です。
検証した時もマビノギを付けながらやっていたのでゲーム単体ならもっと余裕があります。

あとはVisual Studio + Resharperによる開発も行っていますが、起動は数秒程度でビルドも数秒で終わります。
4590時代は起動だけで数分放置していたくらいなのでこの差は大きいですね。
当時はHDDだったのでSSDに変わったのも大きいとは思いますが。

また内蔵のUHD Graphics 630でもしばらくゲームをしていましたが、マビノギ程度の軽いゲームなら画質下と中の間くらいの設定でも60FPS維持できていました。
GTA Vなどのグラフィックに重きを置いたゲームなどは20-30FPS程度しかでないようなのでやっぱりそれなりのGPUは欲しいです。

[排熱]
評価項目に暖かさとかいうよくわからない項目がありましたが、排熱としてレビューします。
TDP125Wと前代の95W(4590はさらに低い65W)よりも上がりましたが、通常使用においては4590と比較してもさほど変わりはないかなと。
アイドリングは大体30-35度程度、ゲーム時は40-55度程度をうろうろしています。
なので、ゲーム程度なら空冷でも問題ないですし、そこまで構える必要はないかな。
ただ、負荷が増すとやっぱり熱は出ますので120mm以上のクーラーは欲しいですね。

[安定性]
処理性能でも述べましたが、基本的に余裕がある状態が常なので安定性は抜群です。
今のところCPUに起因したトラブルは一切ないです。

電力消費に関してもTDP125Wに上がったとはいえゲーム程度なら行って50W程度なのでそこまで消費しないかなと。
4590と比較してもそんな大差はなさそう。
もちろん負荷が少ない状態での話なのでさらに増すと消費電力はもっと上がります。
ベンチマークで230Wくらいいってるレビューも見かけたので電源の選択は余裕をもっておくといいでしょう。
Z490マザボだとCPU電源が8 + 4pin(一部メーカーはH470も)なので、願わくばCPUコネクタ 4 + 4pin x 2があるものを選びたいところ。

[互換性]
Comet Lake-SからソケットがLGA1200と一新されたため、前代のLGA1151とは互換性がありません。
買い替えを検討している方はMBの買い替えも必要なので注意しましょう。

なお、クーラーに関してはLGA1151と取り付け位置が同じなので基本的にLGA1151のクーラーが使えます。
風魔 弐（FUMA2）は公式でも装着可能とのことなので検討中の方はご安心を。
一応購入後のマニュアルではLGA1200がシレッっと追加されていたので公式にサポートしたのかな？",Verified Purchase,sztk,Reviewed in Japan on 14 July 2020,True,[]

,"Don’t let the 125w TDP fool ya because this chip runs WAY cooler than previous gens. Tested temps using OCCT stress test for about 3 hours, alongside my Noctua NH-D15 cooler. The highest I’ve seen the temp spike up to was 71c. Note that OCCT is a heavy synthetic test that pushes the CPU to the limit. Regular gaming temps will never reach that high. I’ve had the chip for almost two months now and accumulated quite a bit of gaming hours during that time. The games I played included a mix of intensive AAA titles like CoD Warzone and AC: Odyssey to light eSport ones such as Rocket League and Rainbow Six Siege. Highest temps are always in the 50s to mid 60s range. That is a huge difference compared to my old i5 6600k that spiked to over 80c at times! My brother who bought a 9900k last year was also amazed by how much cooler 10th gen runs and even said that he wished he waited a bit longer before upgrading. Note that both the 9900k and 6600k have lower TDPs than the 10700k yet still run warmer. The reason as to why 10th gen runs cooler is because intel made modifications to the IHS of the cpu and upgraded their Thermal Interface Material. Other then the improvement in the temperature department, I’ve also noticed a big difference in gaming performance. Despite having a 2080 super, my PC used to struggle to reach and stay at a consistent 100+fps at 1080p. CPU intensive games like AC Odyssey often dropped to like 50fps. This is a clear indication that there was bottleneck on the CPU side. With this new 10700k, My PC now has no problems reaching and maintaining that sweet consistent 144+ FPS on light competitive eSport titles and 100+FPS on demanding CPU intensive AAA titles. Also, note that I am running the CPU at stock settings right out the box and have not messed with overclocking yet. Nonetheless, I am very satisfied with this CPU and I highly recommend it.",Verified Purchase,Daniel C,Reviewed in the United States on 25 July 2020,True,[]

,"Works great, the original one I got from Amazon died on me within 2 weeks it was essentially dead on arrival. This rarely happens but from time to time this can happen.

I contacted Intel and asked for a replacement and they agreed as it was under warranty obviously. While I had to pay like $10 to ship it to them which I originally thought was sorta cheap since other companies like MSI cover the shipping costs I can see why Intel doesn't.

While I only paid $10 for shipping I assumed it would be ground shipping from Canada to the middle of the USA and figured I'd be without a CPU for up to 2-weeks.

Turns out Intel ships via Air and my package was on a Plane and arrived at the facility within 8 hours and I had a new CPU in my computer within 72 hours.

I would highly recommend this product even after my issues because Intel was as fast as possible with replacing mine.

,"I waited too long to switch back to the FPS king. This chip is amazing. I missed you Intel.

The PC world is weird. Always chasing $50 savings. Too many games have CPU bottlenecks. I debated hard between just buying a 3700x to replace my 2700x versus the hard MB/CPU upgrade to Intel. But AMD had left me frustrated. My 2700x was never maxed out and I couldn’t tell what was bottleknecking me. The 3700x didn’t promise much higher clock speeds so I wasn’t sure if an upgrade would help. I play Rust on 1440p and my GPU and CPU would sit at 60% utilization or less with frames only around 70fps. First test with the 10700k stock and I’m at 135fps, max graphic settings. My GPU is now pumping out 99% utilization and the game feels amazing.

This chip runs cool on stock. Idk where all the bad thermal predictions came from, but it didn’t happen. Haven’t even OC’d it yet and honestly I may not need to until I upgrade off of my 2080super. But that’s not happening any time soon. I’m hitting 144fps on 1440p max settings now in every FPS game and that was the goal.

Thank you Intel, you nailed this one. The 9th gen had some cost/heat issues and that made me give AMD a try and I’m glad to be back!

For anyone choosing a card. The 10700k is the sweet spot for gaming and streaming. If you only game, I think the 10600k is a cheaper but same performance. I don’t see any need for the 10900k.",Verified Purchase,Michael,Reviewed in the United States on 5 June 2020,True,[]

,"(a) Considering its current price and given that its gaming performance (without power limits) is overall identical to the 11700k (without power limits too) and just 3-4% slower overall than the 5800x I would say this cpu is the best choice for gaming. After overclocking it actually beats or matches the 5800x overall even when compared against a PBOed 5800x. By ""overall"" I mean when comparing these cpus in a large range of games (30+ games) and not just 4-5, (something that some biased reviews do)

(b) Productivity is very good too although in heavy multithreaded applications (e.g. tile-based rendering) it does lose by 10-20% to both the 11700k and the 5800x. That said it reduces the deficit to only 3-15% in an overclocked vs overclocked battle, thanks to its higher overclocking potential.

(c) It runs pretty cool - I am using a Noctua NH-D15 and is also very silent. Even on stock auto motherboard settings (and with power limits removed) I don't get temps above 68-69C even when running Cinebench R23 in a loop and sustaining indefinitely the stock all-core 4.7GHz. Temps reduce further when you manually tune the voltage to a lower value (a practice known as undervolting) or when you apply a better thermal paste or a case with better airflow. You can also undervolt and still overclock. Or overclock more without increasing the voltage above its stock value.

(d) I paired it with a fairly high-end Asus Z490 (Strix-E) board instead of a Z590 one. There is no reason buying a Z590 board for 10th gen cpus as for the same price you typically don't get ""enthusiast"" features (such as postcode, third PCIe x16 slot, PCIe bifurcation, etc). Moreover most of the ""goodies"" of the Z590 boards (e.g. PCIe4, additional M.2 slot, DMI3x8) are only enabled when using an 11th gen cpu. So buying a Z590 for 10th gen is a bit of a waste.

(e) Currently the price of the 11700K +Z590 is around 200 euros higher than that of the 10700K+Z490 combo. If the difference drops to 60-80 euros then I would advise to go for the former instead.

,"Ryzenとの比較で「コスパ面でみると断然Ryzen」と言われてきましたが、11世代が出て10世代Core i7-10700Kが4万円を切ってくると、むしろこっちのほうがコスパいいと思います。私は38,000円で購入しました。
「最新は必要ないし高いから、ひとつふたつ型落ちでも十分」と考えるなら、買いだと思います。

性能面はもはや語りつくされてるので詳細は割愛します。
私はAdobeの写真と動画編集が主な用途で、Core i-7 2700K（もう10年か…）からの乗り換えですが、めっちゃ快適になりました。起動はそこまで変わらないけど、操作時にもたつくことがなくなりました。最低5年、長ければまた10年はこれでいけそうです。

CPU換装に伴いマザーとメモリも新調したので（それ以外は使いまわし）以下に主な構成を。あまりこだわりはなく、ミドルハイくらいの性能でコスパ良さそうなのを中心に選んでるつもりです。参考までに。

・CPU　Core i7-10700K
・マザー　ASUS TUF GAMING H570-PRO
・メモリ　CFD DDR4-2666 16GB×2
・グラボ　GeForce GTX 1660 super
・クーラー　be quiet! PURE ROCK 150W

【余談】
「Windows11は動かせない」とのレビューがありますが、そんなわけないです。要件はCPUだけではないのでほかの要因だと思います。

追記（2022年2月）
12世代 Core i5-12600K が、i5 にも関わらず i7-10700Kを上回る性能をたたき出しているようです（場面によっては11900すら上回る）。それでいて i5 なので価格はお手頃。恐るべし12世代。

,"Yeah I know, Ryzens are cheaper, and out perform the Intel chips in everything... except clocks. As a gamer, I want the highest single core speed possible, 16 threads instead of 32? Whatever, I don't need that many for my uses, lol.

I don't upgrade often, and until now I was still running my trusty 4790k, which still can hold it's own pretty well, but now with the 10700k, the 1080 isn't bottlenecked by my CPU any more, and it's VERY noticeable in certain games I normally saw slight issues.

Should you upgrade 9th gen, or even 8th gen to 10th gen? Honestly, probably not. But if you're say, a few of more generations behind now, it's a worthy upgrade. Yes it's an upgraded 9900k, but that's still really good for ~$400!

1 MONTH UPDATE:

So yeah it's just shy of a month using it and it's been a beast. I haven't messed with clocks at all since the built in boosts do the job fine, especially paired with the D15 keeping it nice and cool. Haven't gone above 60c in full load yet.

,"I got this i7 because

a) it was in stock
b) I had the budget for it
c) I trust intel more than AMD Ryzen even though AMD Ryzen is considered now as the better hardware (judging by per-core performance). I have always thought Intel's drivers are better, I have also heard recent reports that Ryzen CPUs usage can randomly go up by 20% with just the epic games store running. I can imagine this will be fixed as it sounds more like some dodgy code than the hardware itself.

On every game I have played, I don't think the CPU usage has gone above 40%. So this CPU will definitely last a LONG time before I upgrade.

,"I've had my 10700K for about a month now. I paired it with a brand new Asus Maximus XII Extreme and kept my 2080 ROG Strix. The three make a beautiful pairing. If you aren't planning on overclocking, I'll just say, pick this up and you won't regret it. If you aren't speed-chasing, it isn't worth the extra money of going to the 10900K. If you are overclocking, I personally believe the money-performance ratio puts the 10700K on top. But, speed-chasing would suggest picking up the 10900K.
As expected, temps are a little hot when overclocking. I used XMP I, clocked to 5.1GHz and left voltage on adaptive. My mobo thinks it's a good idea to stick a whopping 1.545v into it to support 5.1GHz and hit over 100C (exact temp unknown, neither of my monitoring programs read hotter than 100C), but that's totally unnecessary. Dropping down to 1.46v, highest temp spike during stress test hit 90C, not a degree warmer (25min stress test using Cinebench, 360mm ROG AIO). My goal is to hit 5.2GHz this evening. If I have the ability to update reviews, I will post results.

It has handled anything I can throw at it with complete ease, I'm yet to see it get anywhere near full load. I paired it with a Noctua air cooler and it keeps the chip very cool.

I fully expect this chips 16 logical cores with very high clockspeed to last quite some time. Very very happy with this chip's performance so far, looking forward to many years of great performance. Intel may not have the best value anymore, but they are reliable and very high performance, which is what I'm looking for.

,"While a good idea anyway, with many processors now utilizing stock overclocks, you can benefit a performance boost by choosing a better CPU cooler. I went the cheap route, actually, I thought it was middle of the road since the Thermaltake Contac Silent 12 is rated for 150w. I thought I could get away with a $30 cooler since I am not planning on overclocking. That cooler could not even keep up with stock CPU settings. In benchmarks the CPU hit 80-Celsius in seconds and gradually up to 90 where I had it set to throttle. In more practical testing, under basic workloads the temps are more reasonable but the Contac Silent 12 has to ramp up to %100 fan speed frequently to keep that way and it is not quiet at that speed. I know somebody is going to say that's because the default settings on the motherboard are overclocking the CPU beyond Intel's recommended settings. Well, that was one of the first things I checked and that's not the case here. Despite what somebody on YouTube said or didn't say, not all motherboards do that. It is a great processor and complements my workload nicely (no games here). The new cooler is a Reeven Justice, $45 right now. I has the same size 120mm fan however it has six heat pipes instead of four and the tower is about %50 thicker and fins stacked closer together. Temps, while still pretty hot, have come down 8-10 degrees on Cinebench R-20. It still gets up to 80-82 Celsius but instead of hitting 80 right away as it did before, it takes until the render is almost complete and seems to level off there. I feel better about the temps now that It's not riding on the ceiling, especially since all core full load is not a typical workload for me. The fan is much quieter during typical use. I would recommend that cooler for those who are looking for a good compatible cooler.",Verified Purchase,Fuzz,Reviewed in the United States on 10 June 2020,True,[]

It's rock solid stable with XMP profile on the RAM and a small cache overclock. This thing absolutely crushes my previous i7-7000k CPU and I noticed a big difference in FPS in quite a few games.

I think I may have gotten lucky on the silicon with this chip. I can hit 5.1Ghz stable but it does start to get a little too hot for my comfort, but i actually dont start thermal throttling until I try 5.2Ghz all core. Again, this is just on air using a Noctua DH-D15 so its possible I could do more with an AIO cooler. With enough cooling and time spent tweaking this chip may very well hit 5.2Ghz all core and remain stable. I'll update the review if i ever give that a shot.

,"DISCLAIMER: This review covers 3 main items (CPU, MOBO, RAM). Links to the other parts are included (all available at Amazon for good prices). You'll read this review on each of the other parts as well.

WHY DID I BUY IT?
I recently built and absolute beast of a computer and kept my older one as a backup. Unfortunately, it decided to take a dive this past week with the motherboard failing catastropically. Given that it was 10 years old, I decided to replace the ""brains"" with something a little more modern, but not overkill. Because I had spent a LOT of money on a computer recently, I was trying to keep the repair under about $400 and here's what I did...

The BRAINS...
Intel i3-10100 Processor ($100): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MMRW87
MSI Mag B460 Motherboard ($110): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GXVP1DM
TeamGroup 16GB DDR4 ($60): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNQVBZ6
*** These are the main parts that MUST be compatible.. and they are ***

I was worried about my hard drive, so I went ahead and splurged on a TeamGroup 1TB SSD ($75 -- www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PX2KKHM) bringing my total to just under $400. I could have kept my old Seagate 500gb 5400 RPM drive but I had a little extra to spend and that greatly sped up boot and wait times.

For what it's worth, I also kept my existing Antec Power Supply (550W) that was replaced about a year ago, my case, and my now very old graphics card (R9 380 - 4gb). I already had a good monitor, mouse, and keyboard so those carried over as well.

So how did it go together? Pretty seamlessly with just 2 little hiccups.

HICCUP #1
RAM: I did not realize the motherboard I purchased has a standard RAM speed of 2666. It can get up to a max of 2933. So the RAM I purchased (3200 speed, CL 16) is overkill and I could have saved another $20 or so. But, I didn't... and it's my first build with TeamGroup RAM and I'm happy with it.

HICCUP #2
LAN/AUDIO: Once I got everything installed, the LAN would not connect to my network (wired, ethernet connection). A little troubleshooting found out YOU MUST TO UPGRADE THE LAN DRIVER for it to work. This means having another computer with internet and a flash drive. Likewise, I went ahead and updated the Audio driver and the sound was much crisper. So... take a moment and download all of the drivers in advance from the MSI website.

FIRST POWER ON: The computer started up, then turned off immediately. It then restarted on it's own and said the motherboard had detected changes so I needed to configure the BIOS. Entering BIOS found that everything was recognized. So I changed the first boot device to USB flash drive and plugged in my Windows 10 install flash drive and restarted.

Bottom Line: The Intel i3-10100 is a great little chip (not overclockable). The MSI 460 Torpedo is a decent motherboard (just update the LAN and Audio drivers) that boots quickly. In fact, it boots so quickly, I don't even see the POST screen. From cold to Windows is easily under 30 seconds.

The RAM is stable at 2666 and fast enough that I probably won't even push the 2933 setting. The SSD is very fast (functionally almost as fast as the M2 drive I have in my beast at a savings of $20-25). Even with the aging R9 graphics card, I'm easily hitting 60 FPS on modern titles at 1080 in medium to high settings. Sometime next year when graphics card prices drop to a reasonable level, I'll update that and have a second gaming rig ready.

Overall, I'm very happy with this setup.",Style Name: Intel Core i3-10100Verified Purchase,Big Orange Wookie,Reviewed in the United States on 2 December 2020,True,[]

,"Built a computer for the relative as a very early Christmas gift or a reverse birthday gift (my birthday, but I give you gifts), who honestly would probably be doing very little with it to justify a 4 core/8 thread current generation processor if it's web browsing, video conferencing, YouTube for music and the general emailing stuff. I put an RX 580 in it as well as 2x8GB 2666 DDR4 RAM and 2 500GB HDDs.

I would definitely say the thing itself is quite the ""sleeper""! It's gonna run your games at console and above performance with a simpler GPU at lower settings, and it'll destroy on a much more advanced GPU. It's a good email/web/very light gaming/YouTube browser alone thanks to this particular CPU's integrated GPU, turning it into an APU (Accelerated Processing Unit). It's not a workstation processor due to its four core and eight thread composition. It can take in eight tasks and work on them, but it can only digest four at a time.

If you're looking for a desktop PC and know how to or someone who does know how to build it, This is all you need and more.

If you're into gaming on a console but want to try it on a computer and have a sub $1000 budget, get this and do some research before building, spend a few weeks on PC building knowledge. I recommend if buying this a B460 Motherboard, 2x8GB RAM sticks, a new HDD/SSD/M.2 PCIe SSD of at least 1TB/500GB/500GB, HDD is slow but cheap, lasts a good few years without fail and large in storage, SSD is fast and usually lasts long with less storage space (do not buy DRAM-less SSDs, lack of SSD RAM will damage the drive much faster), M.2 PCIe SSD is very fast but most expensive, no SATA cables needed but does disable one SATA port on most motherboards due to it sharing the same data lane.

,"So, this is basically an i7-7700, the specs are nearly identical. That's the beauty of Intel, this year's i3 is an i7 from a few years back. This has a couple tricks that the i7 doesn't, like UHD graphics instead of just HD and being able to overclock to a slightly higher frequency, but otherwise it's the same chip for a fraction of the price. I put this in a computer that I use mainly for surfing the web and watching videos, and it doesn't let me down. It's super responsive and the included graphics are a nice option if you don't want to mess with a graphics card. (great for keeping the system low power) I even tried some light gaming on this chip and it works nicely, though that's not the intended purpose of this system.

,"I bought this to go into a desktop as a gift to my parents. The processor has 4 cores and 8 threads, and is very fast. It should be enough processor for them for many years.

The main reasons I decided to buy this over an AMD processor:
* This processor comes with an iGPU and since it won't be used for gaming it is cheaper than a comparable 3300x + GPU combo.
* I wanted to port their existing hard disk over to the new machine, and using this processor allowed me to buy a 16GB intel optane chip for $20. The intel optane chip was excellent for their needs. AMD's current caching product that does something similar is less user friendly. I'm glad I went with intel on this one.

Purchased the least expensive Core i3 CPU just to get my Z490 build up-and-running. At the time, LGA 1200 Core i7 and i9 CPUs were either unavailable or horribly overpriced (by resellers). But now that this CPU has powered my Z490 system for a while, I am amazed at how good it is. See Bill McDonald's excellent comments expressing the same opinion. My DDR4 RAM runs stable at 3600 MHz (XMP) and gaming at 1080p is seamless. And though I've got it water cooled, that is clearly overkill as it never gets hot -- even under load. Full disclosure: I am using a separate GPU (graphics card) instead of the integrated Intel graphics.

When all threads are at 100% load the CPU runs at around 4.07 GHz but when one thread is being used at 100% the CPU will tend to jump around 4.2 or 4.25 GHz. Having 4 cores and 8 threads is really nice sense my CPU before only had 2 cores and 4 threads so it was a nice jump. But the stock cooler on this CPU can get a but noisy, and when the CPU is at 100% load across all cores and threads the temps don't hold up very well.

Monster Hunter World (High settings)

The 13th gen series doesn't even have an i3 let alone less expensive options (at least available retail for DIY builds). But, IMHO, this chip is an albatross.

,"Der Intel Core i3-12100 Prozessor aus der 12. Core-Generation bringt frischen Wind in kompakte NAS-Systeme. Als Einstiegschip der aktuellen Alder Lake-Architektur bietet er nicht nur ausreichend Rechenleistung für anspruchsvolle Server-Aufgaben, sondern überzeugt auch mit einer sehr effizienten Energiebilanz.

Das moderne Hybrid-Design aus vier Performance- und vier Effizienzcores ermöglicht einen stets ausgewogenen Betrieb. Anspruchsvolle Aufgaben wie Video-Transcoding, Multitasking oder Containerisierung werden über die schnellen P-Cores mit hoher Taktrate bewältigt. Für weniger komplexe Hintergrundprozesse übernehmen die stromsparenden E-Cores den Job.

Mit Boosttaktraten bis 4,3 GHz aus der Box bietet der i3-12100 auch ohne Übertaktung enorme Performancereserven für rechenintensive NAS-Workloads wie Videostreaming, Multimediaservices oder Datensicherungsaufgaben. Die moderne Skylake-Architektur und 12MB intelligenter Cache beschleunigen die Datendurchsätze zusätzlich.

Der geringe Strombedarf erlaubt den Einsatz üblicherweise kühlerer und leiser Netzteile und Kühlsysteme. Das reduziert die Betriebskosten und Lärmbelastung des NAS erheblich.

Der Core i3-12100 erweist sich als äußerst wandlungsfähiger Performancebringer für anspruchsvolle Heimanwender und Semi-Profi-NAS-Systeme.

It's single core power is up there with the ryzen 7000 series processors, supporting ddr5 ram at only 90 dollars WITH the cooler. Assuming your average cooler is about 10 dollars, you really can't go wrong with an 84 dollar cpu capable of 500+ fps on minecraft, 300+ fps on valorant, etc.

I will say though, a quad core cpu in 2023 is a bit questionable, since you'll have extra issues streaming and recording games. The cache is also pretty low for this cpu, but you really can't hate too much on a 90 dollar cpu at this magnitude of performance.

But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80°C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80°C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80°c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.

But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS.

El Cooler Master de 120mm mantiene al procesador sin carga o carga mínima entre los 32 y 40 grados y con carga máxima y tests pega a los 80 grados, lo cual simplemente es genial teniendo en cuenta que la temperatura máxima del Procesador es de 125 grados, al radiador le coloqué 2 Ventiladores Noctua a 3000 revoluciones en configuración push / pull. Tengo varios laboratorios de Linux / Oracle 12c y 19c en RAC usando GRID en almacenamiento y he levantado 6 máquinas virtuales (3 RACs) trabajando de manera excelente y con velocidades de respuesta mucho más que excelentes, por lo cual recomiendo ampliamente el procesador i9 Gen 13th para cualquier necesidad que se tenga, felíz con mi compra, al momento de comprarlo el costo fue alrededor de 600 dólares!!",Pattern Name: ProcessorVerified Purchase,El JJ,Reviewed in Mexico on 30 October 2022,True,[]

,"My first review ever. Intel has finally acknowledged this issue, search ""Regarding Reports of 13th/14th Gen Unlocked Desktop Users Experiencing Stability Issues"" on google.

For me, worked great for about a month, then slowly started experiencing stability issues. Games would crash and get an occasional blue screen. After about 6 months, there were noticeable stability issues, with many games unable to boot past main menu, causing blue screen on launch, or experiencing frequent crashes. Friends in separate friend groups would always comment on my computer issues, showing bugs and crashes that have no apparent causes.

After a year, my PC can only run super smash brothers melee with stability and even chrome tabs are crashing now. Discord has to be run on chrome because the app crashes every 10 seconds, I can't play any games. I had dedicated tens of hours into investigating only to realize it's been the CPU all along. I also had to upgrade my motherboard to accommodate this CPU and now I have to investigate if this CPU has caused irreparable damage to the motherboard. I expect Intel will be facing heavy financial losses due to influx of warranties as the issues become more and more public.

,"So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.

Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.

Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.

In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.

,"I got this and a new DDR5 motherboard with Z690 chipset. It didn't boot when I set it all up. It turns out the Z690 needs a BIOS update to work with this CPU. Luckily I had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard. I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update. After that it boots this CPU just fine.
Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter. I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache. But, it just doesn't compete with this i9. I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores. Even with less cache. The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works. It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD. I use a water cooler, but it's not required. Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5.
I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more. But, I want the best of the best, and as of today there is nothing better than this available. If you game, or do graphics, or anything on your PC this is the CPU for you. It will NOT disappoint.

A word on the X790 chipset. You would think they will have better performance because they are newer. They don't. They will work with the i9 no matter what, while the Z690 might need a BIOS update. They have one more USB port. But otherwise there is no benefit to getting Z790 and they cost a LOT more. So, if you have the ability to use an older CPU to flash the bios, or find one that is new enough that it doesn't need the update, this CPU will be great.",Pattern Name: ProcessorVerified Purchase,Adam White,Reviewed in the United States on 22 February 2023,True,[]

I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you don’t want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent. Good luck gamers and editors. Just remember if gaming is the only thing you do then no point spending this much just go a step down on processor.

Buying this bad boy will future proof your computer for now, BUT there are very few people who NEED this kind of cpu.

,"I bought two of these from Amazon after one from another vendor failed to POST. Both worked the first time. Do you need 24 cores for games? Most games use 4 or 6 cores max, so probably not. Video editing can benefit from the extra cores. Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked). Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution. Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility. I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler. With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor. While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C. Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C. Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer.

Also beware that most Motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the BIOS, so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit. For example I'm using an 360mm AIO cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my AORUS ELITE AX when running cinebench it reaches 100°C within 12 seconds of starting. Of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games (there, the max I've seen the CPU get is 67°C) but is something to be aware of.

I figure it was after an update and they turned on some security thing, and I dissabled all the security stuff and still running into issues. I reset the OS, still issues, I do a fresh clean install, still issues. I try replacing the memory, still issues. I try installing win 11 with a different boot installer, still issues. I try windows 10.... still issues. I try reinstalling it 2 more times, still the same issue.

I decide to go to Micro Center to have them diagnose the issue, while i am there, their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code. They take it in, and in 2 days message me saying its the CPU. They tried the CPU in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up. So, i go and pick up the machine.

I try to file a warrenty claim with Intel, but their login system was broken for a week, so I had to chat with a support person. We spend 1 hour typing about the issue. I send him screenshots of the CPU itself, the text from Microcenter, the recepit from Amazon, screenshot of the Bios showing all my hardware information, a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter, a screenshot of the error code.

I wait a week or so, i can finally log into Intel website, and i dont see a support ticket. I open up chat again, i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address. They assign it and forward the support response to me.

And the response says, they cant contact Microcenter to confirm it. And that its not a CPU issue anyways because that code is due to an OS issue.

An OS issue. I ask them to reiterate their point, because if its an OS issue, that means they dont believe me and Microcenter. I also pointed out again that i have installed Windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times.... and they respond with, i need documentation from Microcenter. So, they dont believe me and they believe this is an OS issue still.

Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.

ASUSの簡易水冷(ROG240mm)で運用。ケースが古いので360mmは断念。
定格使用でH.265のエンコード時にCPU温度は80℃後半を維持できます。

Z690マザーなのでオーバークロック。
6コアまでなら倍率54で回ります。温度は90℃に届くかどうか程度。電圧はoffsetで-0.05V。この場合Core temp読みで消費電力は241Wに届きませんでした。
ただ、オールコアをいじり倍率50にしただけで300W近くまで消費するとともにCPU温度は一瞬で100℃へ。即サーマルスロットリングが作動します。

いずれも室温は27℃での検証です。

360mmの簡易水冷にしたとて一瞬で100℃に上がる温度は抑えきれないと思いますのでサーマルスロットリングに当てたくないのであればオーバークロックは難しいのでは？と思いました。
単コアであれば54倍で安定動作しているので満足です。

6700Kからの換装でしたが10分間の動画をH.265にエンコードしたとき、6700Kは約15分、12900Kは約7分で終了。
時代の変化を感じます。

premiere Proでの動画編集(4Kを8ストリーム)でも全コアフルパワーにはなりませんでした。エンコードするときと、ベンチを回すときくらいですかね。

,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7.",Style Name: CPU Core i9-12900KVerified Purchase,Chris H,Reviewed in the United States on 11 May 2023,True,[]

,"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.
After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.
For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.
So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.
Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.

,"Purchased this CPU to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that I have had for close to 4 years now, and considering I also own a 3090 I was lucky enough to get last year, it was time. Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load).",Style Name: CPU Core i9-12900KVerified Purchase,Kira,Reviewed in the United States on 21 February 2022,True,[]

,"I've put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU.

Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.

If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.

My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.

Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.

Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.

,"Upgraded from a 9900k and had a hotter running PC. Couldn't figure it out at first and found myself checking my AIO, reapplying thermal paste, checking settings, etc. After research I was able to discover that given it a slight undervolt helps. What ended up helping even better and easier was ticking down the performance in the Performance Menu.

In those option by simply ticking down the processor to 99% my temps went down to 55 for most of my games from initially running at average 80-85. This tuning comes without a noticeable hit on FPS except while playing ""Squad"" (a single core use cpu intensive game). With that game I do lose at least 10 fps by having the processor at 99%. This is not that big of a deal as I can easily tick it up to 100% for Squad and just put up with the 75-80 temps!

,"This was Intel's top line CPU in the 11th generation; it used the LGA-1200 socket which was only minimally different from the LGA-1151 socket (1200 pins vs. 1151 pins). The motherboards for the LGA-1200 required only small changes in production spec, and the coolers made for the 1151 chips work perfectly on the LGA-1200. By contrast, the 12th generation, using the LGA-1700 socket, required an extensive redesign of motherboards, and the coolers that got adapted over from the LGA 1151/1200 didn't really work properly on the 12th and 13 generation Intel CPUs. This i9-11900K will pull about 170 watts through the socket at factory overclock 100%, and that's right on the limit of safe operation for the vast majority of air or liquid coolers on the market today.",Style Name: CPU OnlyVerified Purchase,mlm,Reviewed in the United States on 3 October 2023,True,[]

,"I am not a gamer by a long shot, but wanted a powerful Intel based CPU riding on an 'Asus Maximus Extreme Motherboard' along with a Asus RTX 4090 GPU. I purchased (1) of the most graphic intensive AAA game titles and a few CPU intensive military strategy simulation games known for their heavy demand for CPU physics computations. My Core i9-11900K which I purchased in 2022 performed admirably well on all accounts. Absolutely no complaints. Some reports say that the i9-11900K runs hot and sometimes above the 100°C mark? But that was not really the case with me or the many others when they installed a high quality 360mm or above sized AIO water cooler. My very demanding combat simulation (Command: Modern Operations) never presented a heating issue with the i9-11900K and with my over 80-hours of heavy duty play. For good measure my Cosmos C700M EATX case also includes a total of (7) additional independent Noctua cooling fans, which of course benefits the cooling within the massive interior of the enclosure.

Youre gonna need a new board, water cool this thing, gen 4 nvme drive, new 30 series gpu's (cause they utilize gen 4 pci-e slots) heres a simple breakdown of a good starting point when getting this cpu:

Step 1: get an 11th gen processor (this i9 if its in your budget)
Step 2: get a motherboard with gen 4 pcie slots (z590-e was my go to)
Step 3: obviously water cool this unlocked beauty cause it'd be a shame not to get it to 5.3ghz (done safely with corsair's H150i elite capellix; hovers around 40's in degrees Celsius)
Step 4: get a gen 4 nvme solid slate drive (might as well go samsung 980 pro for the 7000mb/s reads)

,"The seller did an amazing job.
The item came even sooner than expected.
The bad news is that I installed it in my previously flawless running machine. The reason I upgraded from my current i910900k is that I wanted to enable the NVME.2 4.0 on my SSD. I already had the drive and a Z590 motherboard so why not right? I put the new i9 11900k In and it started and enabled the 4.0 on my NVME. Yay right! Literally with in a couple minutes I received a watchdog timeout error. (This is caused by CPU cores failing to communicate with each other.)

I got into mine for under $410.00 with an ITX motherboard. This suddenly changes the 11900K to being an excellent value.

I also got lucky and hit the silicon lotto and got a golden chip that stable overclocks to 5.1 or 5.2 if you really want to push it but you’ll def need a mobo with beefy vrms to get there. I paired it with a Maximus xi extreme mobo, RTX 2080ti founders and did a complete custom loop with dual 360rads, one for cpu and one for gpu with all ekwb waterblocks. Overclocked with 64gb ram @3200mhz with stable xmp enabled I was able to run stress tests for 12 hours and never got above 70c on the cpu and 45on gpu. This processor doesn’t come with thermal paste or a cooler so I’d highly recommend going thermal grizzly or arctic mx4 thermal paste and some sort of watercooling and just note If you really want to get this stable at high clocks you’ll need a premium mobo that can deliver the power to the cpu, and if your doing custom loop I’d recommend setting up the loop so the gpu doesn’t go straight to the cpu and try to separate them for optimal temperatures.

,"This was the ""ks"" version, so out the box it runs at 5GHz on all threads. It is the same CPU in most ways as the regular ""k"" version (i9-9900k) but it is highly binned so only the best silicon is used for i9-9900k.

It is a kind of ""silicon lottery guanrantee."" Those who want 5GHz on all threads will get it with this model.
As everyone knows no two cpus are the same. An i9-9900k (not ks) might be as good with overclocking, but no way to know, it's possible that it will never go above rated speed if unlucky with the ""silicon lottery.""

Negative Point: Warrantee is only 1 year. Others are 3 years. As overclocking voids warranty if any OC is detected the warranty of all chips is cancelled so it makes little difference to any overclocker.

I wonder why 1 year though? Intel said because replacement stock is sold out quickly for this ""special,"" version. Mmmmm. Also they know customers of this are likely to be enthusiast and OC can be hidden. Also the TDP is higher: 95w regular. This is 127w.

The price increase is small, so for me the only small downside/question is it.
It is by far the fasted 9th gen cpu out of the box. Many can be overclocked to 5.1GHz, and with good cooling a lot will manage 5.2GHz. The only enemy of 5.2GHz is HEAT. Make sure to have a good mobo with best VRMs, and use powerful cooking. I use Arctic 2 which is different thickness than othe AIO. Standard for all compaies is 27mm. This is deeper, 34mm approx so check it fits. Lenghe is no issue. Arctic 2 was the best 280 AIO available at time of purchase.

,"Is it worth paying a premium, for the guaranteed performance that you may or may not achieve with the 9900K? I generally will hang on to a system for 3-5 years before doing a major upgrade. So, in my case, knowing that I have the best of the best was important. Mine runs at 5.1 on all cores without breaking a sweat.

It's worth remembering that all the very best 9900K's will serve as the basis for the ""KS"", so your chances of receiving just a mediocre ""K"" will increase dramatically.",Style Name: 9900KSVerified Purchase,BobbyBoy,Reviewed in the United States on 12 November 2019,True,[]
,"Buyer beware. When I installed this into my MSI MEG Z390 Godlike, after getting it all built I powered it up and!.................... nothing. This processor is new enough that when you install it on your motherboard you are very likely to not get any display and in my case, now I have to actually take my computer to a shop so that they can give the board the BIOS update needed to get everything working. The appeal of this processor running all cores at 5 GHz is salivating but I'm pretty disappointed that I never discovered this issue in the research I did before buying this. It will be at least a week or two now where I have a large paper weight desktop computer and no running computer until I can get this fixed.

,Got this CPU to have the “best” gaming cpu. That IS what I now have. However I also love overclocking and benchmarking. Having paid for a binned CPU I feel I should easily hit 5.2ghz stable with an MSI godlike MOBO and EKWB custom water loop. However going over 5.1GHz even with almost 1.4v power to cpu will not pass prime95 or Intel burn stability tests. Guess maybe I failed the silicone lottery? However it runs very stable at the 5GHz as advertised.

,"This started a new PC build for me when it was on sale for $320. I haven't built a PC since 2007, so it has changed a bit since then. This thing runs hot at full load. Watch gamers nexus on YouTube. It will pull a solid 250+ watts running cinebench. I'm using an Arctic Freezer 2 420mm with a thermal grizzly contact frame and kryonaut, and it will load up to 80 degrees almost instantly without throttling but drop immediately to 25-30 degrees when the load stops. This is with ambient at 22 degrees.

This thing is brutally fast, though, and in reality, outside of load testing it, I have rarely seen it go over 30% usage. The more recent i5 and i7 processors can more or less be equal in most use cases. i5 13/14600, i7 13/14700.

This processor is still top-tier and will be for a few years to come. 12th gen i-series processors were a game-changer, the 13th-gen improved on them a bit with more e-cores, and the 14th-gen is looking like a stop-gap to the next big thing.

,"I came from an AMD 2990WX build that while it was good and stable, always had some quirks about it that just annoyed the crap out of me at best. While this probably can't multithread to the same degree, it does represent a lot of power and speed. 5.2GHz across 8 cores / 16 threads, on an air cooler and I'm not touching anything for OC...it's great as it is. Even the 'slow' cores clock in upwards of 4GHz, which the TR tapped out at best with 4.2 and that was only for a couple cores-worth.

This one on air, does back off that max clock not soon afterwards; but I also have this in a 4u rack mounted case, with 4 chassis fans; vs the previous build which was on a 360 radiator/AIO, and had 13 system fans; but I was going for a rather ridiculous build with that vs this build I'm going for subtle/sleeper.

,"Let’s start with the seller; outstanding. Amazon advertised a 2 day delivery if I ordered within 2 hours. I did but the order defaulted to a week delivery. I contacted the seller who promptly upgraded my delivery for free and it arrived in excellent condition exactly as the seller promised. Superb service, thank you!

The item; brand new and sealed as you expect to see if you purchased from a physical store. Simple and easy to install the chip which was automatically detected by the PC and the improvement was immediately noticeable.

The cooling assembly looks the part with a larger heat sink area compared to the old CPU but sadly the mount was incompatible with my motherboard so I had to revert to using the old heat sink. Seems to be fine so far but I’ll keep an eye on it. The reason for the incompatibility is my original mounting is achieved using 4 spring-mounted Philips screws but the new cooler is supplied with plastic press studs that were too wide to insert into the threaded holes.

The new cooler comes with the thermal paste pre-applied so simply a case of scraping it off with a knife and spreading it onto the old heat sink.

,"Was able to snag this for about $150 before taxes on a random flash sale, and used it to upgrade my home theater PC, which I mainly use for VR and more casual titles at 4K in my living room.

For me, this replaced an aging i7-6700K. The performance uplift is night and day between the two, and this would make a fine chip for any new gaming PC you might put together today. Please note that the F variant does not have integrated graphics, but if you already have a GPU then this won't matter for you. This is only 6 cores, 12 threads as well. Being an 11th generation chip from Intel, there's no performance vs. efficiency core debate here, 6 cores is what you get.

One word of caution is that as I write this review this CPU is currently listed for $199, which is about the most I'd recommend paying for this CPU. The $150 price I paid was fantastic of course, but it's not something I would rely on getting again even with Black Friday/Cyber Monday coming soon. A newer i5-12400 will offer similar levels of performance for roughly the same or potentially less money, though that isn't overclockable. A 12600K would blow this out of the water, but you're looking at a far more expensive CPU. The Ryzen 5600 or 5600X are also great foils for this CPU, especially if they can be had for a cheaper price. The AMD chips also have the advantage of cheaper motherboards for that generation compared to the Intel chips at the moment.

End of the day, if you can get this for a good price, go for it, but this wasn't the absolute greatest even for its time, and newer chips can sometimes be had for a better price.",Style Name: Processor 6 CoresPattern Name: ProcessorVerified Purchase,James Capsas,Reviewed in the United States on 19 November 2022,True,[]

,"The 9400F has six cores (no Hyper-Threading), a boost clockspeed of up to 4.10 GHz and base clock of 2.9GHz (it should run at 3.9GHz on all cores, though), a TDP of 65W, and support for up to 128GB of memory. The 'F' means there's no integrated graphics support, so you absolutely need a dedicated GPU to get any kind of video output—just like with most of AMD's Ryzen processors.

Pros :
* Leading game performance.
* Discounted price compared to vanilla Core i5-9400.
* Flimsy bundled cooler is better than nothing.

Cons :
* Disabled graphics (GPU Card is mandatory).
* Locked ratio multiplier.
* Big price-to-performance disadvantage compared to AMD in threaded workloads.

,"If you have a GPU anyway, then this presents great value for the price. Benchmarks are 5-10% better than Ryzen 3400G which is at the same price range. Ryzen 3600, on the other hand, performs 10-12% better than this GPU while costing 50% more. I didn’t quite see the value there.

Keep in mind that this won’t work without a dedicated graphics card. If you do not have a GPU or if you are planning to get one after a while, go for Ryzen 3400G. Out of the box, it has pretty good on-board graphics. Even better if you can buy 3600.

The other thing to note is the motherboard. Intel series 300 chipset is a must here. Ok, so even if you save some money with the CPU, the motherboards are pretty expensive. Odds are you’d be spending the same if you go for 3600G (which is better and has on board graphics) with a cheaper motherboard.",Verified Purchase,Arjun Ajith,Reviewed in India on 8 December 2019,True,[]

,"If you are upgrading your old pc then go for it. It is the best processor for budget up to ₹15,000. Pair it with atleast b360 chipset motherboard or above. Don't use b310 motherboard. It's for pentium processor.
It is better processor than AMD's Processor up to ₹18000.
If you have a budget of ₹20,000. Make sure to go with Intel i5 9600k.
For 1080p gaming pair it with atleast GTX 1660ti and 3000mhz ram. 1650 ti and 1660 is also reasonable choice at slightly less performance.
Pros
Best processor of it's class, it can beat most of amd ryzen 5 processor.
Powerfull and good for beginner gaming as well as for smoothly day to day uses.
Cons
It must need a graphic card for display.
Doesn't support 3000mhz and above Ram. It supports 2666mhz ram. 3000mhz ram works fine at 2666mhz ; over clocking can be done only in atleast z370or above board.
Overall very good processor for budget gamer and streamers for Trend of Pubg Mobile as well as PUBG PC.
Pair it with atleast b360m gaming and above motherboard. Ram must be 2666mhz or above. 3000mhz works fine.

,"📋 ⭐Descrizione del Prodotto⭐ :
l'Intel® i3 12100F è un processore di 12° generazione,dotato di 4 core
ad alte prestazioni di ultima generazione e 8 thread,monta su schede
madri con attacco LGA1700,supporta le Ram DDR4 e DDR5,supporta le
connessioni PCI-E 5.0 e 4.0,ha un clock di sistema da un minimo
di 3.3GHz e fino a 4.3GHz,ha un consumo minimo di 60W e 89W di
picco,non è previsto l'overclock per alzare ulteriormente la
frequenza operativa,ma supporta l'overclock delle RAM sia in
DDR4 che in DDR5,questa funzione gli permette di guadagnare
in prestazioni (soprattutto nel gaming) quasi paragonabili
all'overclock del processore se fosse sbloccato.

Questa è in sintesi la sinossi di questo processore,
il web è pieno di recensioni molto più tecniche che
spiegano perchè l'Intel i3 1200F è al momento,
la migliore ed unica CPU da gaming nella
fascia dei 110/130 euro.

Le prestazioni sono inequivocabilmente eccellenti per chi
desidera giocare in full-hd mantenendo un budget basso.

Inoltre in molti videogames se la gioca alla pari con
processori dal costo quasi doppio e con qualche Core in più.

Si difende molto bene anche nei benchmark a singolo core,
tuttavia nei carichi con molti core perde qualcosa ovviamente.

La doppia compatibilità sia con DDR4 che con DDR5 e con
il PCI-E 4.0 e 5.0 ci permette di poter scegliere anche
una scheda madre dal prezzo adeguato al nostro budget,
come ad esempio una H610 compatibile con l'i3 12000F
ma che supporta le sole DDR4 e il PCI-E 4.0.

Quindi scheda madre economica e che monta RAM DDR4 facilmente
reperibili a prezzi più umani delle DDR5 giusto per capirci,inoltre l'i3
12000F è prestante e competitivo anche con le DDR4 e vari test
sul web lo dimostrano.

📦 ⭐Confezione⭐ :
La scatola è nel classico colore Intel,con sigillo da rimuovere,
a riprova di un prodotto nuovo,all'interno troviamo il processore
nella sua vaschetta in plastica,un ottimo dissipatore intel,adeguato
alla CPU in oggetto con già il cerotto dissipante applicato alla sua base,
un sintetico manuale con attaccato nella pagina principale l'adesivo staccabile
di Intel® Core i3 da apporre,se si vuole,sul fronte del case.

🚚 ⭐Spedizione⭐ :
A cura di Amazon,quindi rapida,sicura e
conforme agli standard dell'azienda.

📉📈 ⭐Considerazioni finali⭐ :
Un ottimo processore dalle ottime performance se si vuole tenere la spesa in
un certo range ma che si difende benissimo sia nel gaming che nei lavori di
tutti i giorni.

il mio voto personale relazionato al rapporto Prestazioni/prezzo
è di ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ stelle.

La mia scala di voto è così definita:
⭐️ stella prodotto da evitare
⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto insufficiente,
⭐️⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto sufficiente,

,"mi sono imbattuto nel processore Intel Core i3-12100F e sono rimasto piacevolmente sorpreso dalla sua potenza e versatilità.
Prima di tutto, devo sottolineare la fluidità delle prestazioni.
Grazie alla sua architettura moderna e ai quattro core fisici, il i3-12100F gestisce senza problemi tutte le attività quotidiane, dalle sessioni di navigazione web alle sessioni di gioco più impegnative.
Ho notato un netto miglioramento nelle prestazioni rispetto al mio vecchio processore, specialmente in applicazioni multithreading.

,"Cette 12ème génération de processeurs Intel est décidément excellente !
Depuis 20 ans, je n'avais acheté que du AMD, mais à le lecture de nombreux tests qui avaient mis en avant les qualités du 12100F, j'avais donc décidé de franchir le pas.
Au départ, je voulais un processeur à la fois suffisamment puissant dans les jeux, et qui ne chauffe pas (et donc qui ne consomme pas). Déjà parce qu'il était destiné à être placé dans un HTPC, ayant par essence un airflow un peu compliqué, et ensuite car je souhaitais optimiser le rapport performances/énergie.
Je pense que c'est mission accomplie. En lecture de films, ou pendant l'écoute de musique, le processeur Intel et la carte graphique (GTX 1660 TI) ne dépassent pas chacun les 35°c, et grimpent respectivement à 47°c et 62°c lors des sessions de jeux.
Je précise que le 12100F est refroidi par un ventirad Low Profile Noctua NHL-12S, appuyé par un ventilateur Arctic P12, et est fixé au socket par un cadre d'ajustement, sensé éviter les déformations de la surface du processeur, de marque Thermalright.
En terme de puissance, ce processeur peut-être associé à n'importe quelle carte graphique sans limiter le potentiel de cette dernière, sauf peut-être celles au-dessus des très puissantes AMD RX 6900 XT et des RTX 3080 TI.
En applicatif en revanche, l'Intel pêchera un peu sans pour autant être ridicule. Sachez qu'elle a autant de répondant qu'un haut de gamme d'il y a 4 ans.

Une chose est sûre, ce processeur et bien l'un des piliers du gaming en 2019.

Avec une base clock de 3.6Ghz et une turbo clock à 4.6Ghz (un seul coeur), ce processeur fait extrêmement bien le taff, titillant les i9-9900K et autres... (en jeu)

Mais, ne vous méprenez pas ! Je parle bien ici de performances de gaming pures et non de performances de workstation car, pour cela, les Ryzens d'AMD sont bien meilleurs. En rapport qualité/prix également. Veuillez compter + ou - 250 à 300€ pour une plateforme AMD alors que chez Intel, on est plus sur du 350 à 500€ (pour de l'overclocking en chipset Z390) et tout ça simplement pour le processeur, la méthode de refroidissement et la carte mère.

Ce processeur est très bon. Ayant des performances similaires à un i7-8700K une fois OC à 5Ghz, il est le gros bonnet à abattre du côté d'AMD. Pour ma part, avec un Core Voltage de 1.38V, je l'ai OC à 5Ghz sur tous les cœurs remontant mon score Cinebench R15 de 1032 (4.3Ghz) à 1243 (5Ghz) & R20 de 2657 (4.3Ghz) à 3030 (5Ghz).

Il n'y a pas à dire, une fois une bonne solution de refroidissement installée ainsi que des connaissances en overclock, on peut facilement atteindre de bonnes performances avec un processeur qui, je le rappelle, ne vaut que 205€ (je l'ai eu pour 270€).

Pour conclure je dirais que, pour une solution efficace en terme de performances en jeu pures et en terme de performances de légère workstation, je conseille vivement ce processeur !",Verified Purchase,Hateroz,Reviewed in France on 16 March 2019,True,[]
,"This review is for: Intel Core i5-9600K processor. I previously owned an i5-4670K on an ASUS Z97-A Motherboard. This 9600 is it's replacement along with an ASUS PRIME Z390-A Motherboard. Temps are great...idle around 30 celsius and under load no more than 55 Celsius. PC does everything I need and a little more with this processor.

I will note: THIS CPU DOES NOT COME WITH A COOLING FAN! My previous i5 had come with a fan and I expected this to come with one as I did not see it listed as CPU only no fan. Well there's no Fan but that's ok because I had already bought a Noctua cooler to go with it anyway. They have the best mounting system I've ever seen hands down! From what I've seen most CPU's no longer come with a fan anyway...which I didn't really know prior. So if you buy this or any other intel CPU make sure it has a cooler or buy one with it!

This CPU, like any i5, is great for pretty much anything including gaming but it does have it's limits.

,"Es de advertir que se recomienda adquirir este modelo o sus hermanos mayores y menores solo si se tiene una placa base Intel con el socket LGA 1151 y estirar lo mas que se pueda la inversión, ya que a partir de ahora sino se ha migrado a la octava/novena o a la décima gen en estas fechas del 2021, no se aconseja adquirir dichos modelos ya que se quedaran desafados con la llegada de la familia Rocket Lake, la onceava generación, por la inclusión de una nueva unidad de procesamiento grafico en los entrantes procesadores, que hará temblar a cualquier GPU dedicada de bajo presupuesto con mas de 4-5 años o más a sus espaldas, con mejoras en la arquitectura como para poder jugar con soltura a 60 FPS con buena calidad.

Mientras la PC me acepte todo lo que le eche, estaré satisfecho. Después me las apañare para conseguir una NVIDIA RTX 3070, si se resurte de nuevo el mercado con suficiente stock.

Este modelo no incluye el disipador chusco que suele incluir Intel en sus modelos mas básicos y algunos de alta gama que no incluyen la denominación K, ya este este modelo esta desbloqueado de fabrica para realizar la practica del overclock, siempre y cuando se instale en una placa base con el chipset Z370/390.

,"Nel corso di questi tre anni, l'i5-9600K ha vissuto momenti di intensa attività e giornate di relativa tranquillità. Dal fotoritocco al rendering, passando per sessioni di gaming ad alta definizione, non c'è stato un solo momento in cui abbia sentito il bisogno di un processore più potente. Il vero test, però, è arrivato quando ho iniziato a lavorare da casa, dovendo gestire diverse applicazioni contemporaneamente. Nonostante il carico di lavoro, l'i5-9600K ha dimostrato di essere all'altezza della situazione, permettendomi di svolgere le mie attività senza alcun rallentamento.

Punti di Forza:
Il principale punto di forza di questo processore è senza dubbio la sua performance. L'i5-9600K è infatti un vero e proprio campione di velocità e multitasking, capace di gestire anche i carichi di lavoro più pesanti senza alcun problema. Inoltre, nonostante le elevate prestazioni, il calore generato rimane sempre nei limiti della norma, un dettaglio non da poco se consideriamo che un'eccessiva temperatura può ridurre la vita del processore e danneggiare altri componenti del PC.

Punti di Debolezza:
Nonostante l'i5-9600K sia un ottimo processore, non è esente da difetti. Il primo è legato al costo: se da un lato la qualità e le prestazioni sono indubbie, dall'altro il prezzo potrebbe risultare proibitivo per chi sta assemblando un PC con un budget limitato. Un altro aspetto da considerare è l'assenza di un dissipatore nella confezione, elemento che dovrà quindi essere acquistato separatamente. Infine, per sfruttare al meglio le capacità di overclocking dell'i5-9600K, sarà necessario disporre di una scheda madre e di un sistema di raffreddamento adeguati.

Conclusioni:
Nonostante alcune piccole pecche, l'i5-9600K è un processore che consiglierei senza esitazioni. Che siate gamer, professionisti o semplici appassionati di informatica, con questo prodotto avrete a disposizione un componente capace di fare la differenza. A tre anni dal mio acquisto, posso affermare di essere pienamente soddisfatto della mia scelta e di non aver mai avuto motivi per pentirmi.",Verified Purchase,InsiemeVuoto,Reviewed in Italy on 10 July 2023,True,[]

,"I have been building my own gaming pc's since 2011. In an effort to save a few $$, I opt to use the i5 vs the i7 and go for a higher end graphics card. While this may not be the optimal choice for most gamers, it has been a good working strategy for me.

The gaming pc's I have built have been serviceable for as long as 5 years, with my last one retired utilizing an i5 3570K which my wife had been using when I upgraded my system in 2017 toan i5 7600K.
Both of these sysytems rocked gaming for me, never a problem, glitch, slowing of frame rates etc.

When the 3570K system started having some motherboard issues, I rebuilt a pc for my wife integrating the bulk of my 2017 i5 7600k build into it. She has a blazing fast pc and is quite content with it.

Filling the void, I built my current system with the Core i5 9600K, using a 1TB NVMe M.2 PCIe Gen3x4 ssd as the main drive and a Samsung 1TB evo ssd for secondary. This is the fastest pc I have ever owned, with remarkably fast boot up and loading speads. The M.2 ssd makes boot time from the appearance of the bios screen to Windows between 4.2 seconds the fastest and 4.8 seconds being the slowest...remarkable.

Gameplay is fantastic. I mostly play FPS & 3rd person shooters, and a few other type games like the Tomb Raider series. It may of course be my imagination, but evrything appears to be faster, more sharp and extremely fluid. I' sold on this cpu!

,"Blue Team representz (update Ryzen 7nm)

J'ai eu ce CPU à 235€ en Mai et je pense avoir fait l'affaire du siècle. Ca me semble relativement raisonnable pour un usage domestique orienté gaming. Il faut reconnaître maintenant la supériorité des Ryzen 7 sur l'applicatif pur et le calcul, mais ce processeur à 6 coeurs fait un excellent travail malgré tout. Il faut vraiment aller chercher des processeurs 8 et 12 coeurs d'AMD pour voir l'écart se creuser fortement, mais sur les applis. Pas sur les jeux.

En effet, sur le Gaming, AMD ne semble pas encore avoir trouvé sa voie. Malgré un design un peu daté et une finesse de gravure 2x plus grosse, le Coffee Lake conserve encore sa supériorité grâce à l'optimisation de sa micro-architecture pour les jeux. Et donc, le jeu sur Intel, c'est vraiment top. Six coeurs suffisent tranquillement à tous les jeux actuels, et leur optimisation assure vraiment une fluidité top.

A noter: même quand on a derrière une bonne carte graphique, un CPU récent fait bondir les FPS. Mention spéciale aux vieux jeux mono-coeur (Skyrim) qui bénéficient alors de perfs imbattables. Encore une fois: malgré des efforts considérables et remarquables, AMD n'a pas pu battre le Papy Intel sur le secteur des jeux vidéo. Les benches sont sans appel (*).

Ce CPU est peu énergivore, très stable, overclockable facilement et sans effort, et monte raisonnablement en chaleur. Il s'adapte spontanément à toutes les fréquences mémoires, y compris avec des carte-mère de milieu de gamme. AMD a rattrapé ses énormes problèmes de compatibilité mémoire, mais Intel n'en a simplement pas :P

Ce qui est potentiellement dommage, c'est qu'il soit vendu sans ventirad. Mais par contre tout ventirad précédent d'Intel devrait s'adapter sur votre carte-mère car leurs sockets sont interchangeables. De manière générale, mieux vaut investir dans un ventirad correct et le réutiliser tant qu'il est compatible: par exemple, je conserve mon Noctua depuis 2012 et je n'ai même pas besoin d'acheter de kit de compatibilité pour le monter sur ce proc. A noter: le ventirad des Ryzen 7 est de qualité très inférieure à celui des gammes précédentes: donc, pour les joueurs AMD il faut également acheter un ventirad.

Au final, dans cette gamme de prix, on a ici un processeur surpuissant pour les jeux, et qui se retrouve vendu à un prix raisonnable, y compris par rapport au Ryzen 7nm 3600 & 3600X. On dit qu'AMD est champion des bas prix, mais le 9600K dépasse ces deux références pourtant toutes nouvelles, et s'est aligné en prix sur eux. Pire encore pour AMD: les carte-mère compatibles x570 sont vendues à des prix absolument exorbitants (220 euros), même s'il est possible sous conditions et au cas par cas d'utiliser des générations inférieures vendues à un prix plus abordable.",Verified Purchase,Thierry B.,Reviewed in France on 18 May 2019,True,[]
,"AMAZING processor! Using a 1660 and was previously using an i5 3570. Bought this and my system has never been faster! I've gotten almost DOUBLE the performance in nearly every game (tiny exaggeration).
6c/6t is perfect for gaming!
The CPU does well in other applications too like Premiere, Photoshop, Blender, etc.
If your motherboard supports overclocking, it makes this processor even better! It ran at 4.3GHz at stock, but I managed to bump it to 5GHz on all cores! (Just a note; Stock runs extremely fine as it is, But OCing will give a bit of a performance boost and if you OC right, it can provide extra stability).

Mind you this is ALL on HDR10 50"" TELEVISION xD I know. I need a monitor, its coming, btw I get a solid 40-60 frames 30 in ERY intense situations, thats because I need a better monitor lol this thing is 120Hz for TV but its not your standard 165Hz monitor which I require. ANYWAYS. Shes a beaut and barely hits 100% in extreme situations. Like currently my CPU is at 10-15% Usage, GPU is at 15-20%, VRAM at 44% and RAM at 37%. With like 7 programs running. In game My GPU maxes 100%, thats normal guys lol, VRAM will be like 60-70%, TOPS 90-95% on insane games, with the RAM constantly following at arounf 7-15% behind it, And the CPU maintains a strong 80% with Quality and performance High and well, even at 100% on Space Engineers it handles fine, Frames and all, but i dont wanna push her, thats why I disable any extreme performance overrides in my motherboards software manager. Sony Vegas btw this thing handles flawlessly for editing with right settings. just disable Extreme performance from your Motherboards Software manager and turn it to a balance setting, and also shes VERY quiet with right cooling installed, I myself have a water cooler and 14 fans for internal.

Parlando con dei tecnici non esistono CPU con adesivi sopra, fanno proprio ridere e credevano fosse stata una truffa o comunque fosse fake.
Il prodotto sostituivo però è riuscito a farmi chiudere un occhio grazie alle sue prestazioni, medio-alte, riuscendo a fare 60 FPS su giochi come Fortnite, soltanto con la GPU integrata (occhio che le prestazioni erano assolutamente le peggiori, ma comunque sono rimasto colpito). Un ottimo prodotto, non ho avuto modo di provare però la possibilità dell'overclockaggio, mi spiace.

I can say, I am very happy with this system. I gained a significant amount of performance from the old CPU. A good 25 to 30% in frame rates.

One game I play a lot is Star Citizen (Alpha stage game in development) and I was worried the loss of the threads might kill my frame rates but it didn't. Playing 1440 resolution and I am gaining 5 to 10 fps on planet landing zones and out in space or on moons I am now hitting 55 to 70 fps. Was outside Port Olisar and running a steady 55 fps.

,"Intel does one thing really well all the time. And that single core performance. The i-5 has a super crazy high clock speed, with turbo or manual overclocking. So for $200 you can really get a lot out of this chip.
In my experience, mainly using this chip as a workstation CPU, I find that it's a little lackluster especially for 4K video editing but that's just due to the nature of it being a more or less budget CPU. If you want the best bang for the buck, then the AMD Ryzen 5/7 line can be had for a lesser price (or same price for a ryzen 7) and you will have much better threading performance which is very useful for video editing and rendering.

As a gaming PC, this thing rang SWBF2 at ultra setting without a hiccup thanks to a beast graphics card so no complaints as a casual gaming chip.

Overall, if you are not buying a motherboard that can over clock this CPU, you're wasting your money. The i-5 shines when you start boosting it. Especially for gaming and tasks that don't require multiple cores for optimized usage. Be warned it does run a little hot because of it's high voltage and the fans will start spinning fast early.

Algo necesario que hay que saber es que se menciona que tiene una frecuencia Turbo de 4.6 GHz, pero esta es la frecuencia máxima por un solo núcleo, se podría lograr alcanzar esta frecuencia con un poco de overclock pero hay que considerar tener un disipador medianamente eficiente para esa tarea, ya que la frecuencia máxima por los 6 núcleos es de 4.3 GHz.",Verified Purchase,Adriana,Reviewed in Mexico on 1 September 2020,True,[]

For you people reading this review that aren't really into overclocking and you are asking yourself is this still a good CPU at stock? Yes it definitely is.

,"I was really debating for a long time whether to go with Intel or AMD. I know that lately AMD offers SKUs with very strong capabilities and good price points that made my decision making process very complicated. In reality, many of us do not need the workstation horsepower of the AMD Ryzen or the i9 9900k. I surf the web, day trade, play Need-for-Speed and Hitman, and this I5 9600k is so good. I overclocked it to 5.1 and 5.2, run the Cinnebench R15 and R20 and the system is stable. The max uncore I achieved is 48. It does not go higher than that. For 5.2 Mhz, I have to increase the power in order to be stable. I have not crashed it on 5.0 and 5.1 Mhz, but for 5.2, I have to play with the power settings. I do not play multiplayer online games, so I hear that this CPU is not good for that. If you are thinking to play in such environment, you should either opt for i7 9700k/ i9 9900k. I still think that AMDs zen 1 and zen 2 are very good CPUs and their price point is way better than Intel, so it is difficult to choose one. I know that AMD requires more expensive RAM modules, but you can go with a cheaper b450 mother board, so you can build an overall better machine for the money. On the other hand, I use very specialized software and I do not want to run into optimization issues. If you ask me whether I would buy this CPU again.

,"Really great CPU overall. Bought this to replace a i5 6600k so it was a relatively big upgrade. Was about 35-40% increase in performance on standard clock but this chip overclocked pretty easily. Got it running at 5Ghz on all cores at 1.372V, doesn’t ever touch above 80*C unless running harsh AVX stress tests such as Prime 95. All other stress tests sit ~75*C which I’m happy with. Gaming it normally sits around 65*C. (This CPU is paired with a Corsair H110i-GT cooler, 3200Mhz DDR4 RAM, and a MSI z390a-pro gaming).

The gaming performance is really good in this chip, like really good. There is only a ~5% difference between the 9600k,9700k and 9900k according to a lot of benchmarks. So for the price point this CPU is superior to its competitors. AMD can’t compete at this price point for gaming performance - they’ll suffer a 10-15% loss compared to the i5 due to their lower single-core performance; especially when overclocked. I play most newer games at 1080p max settings and get around 60FPS. For some games such as Overwatch I get a solid 150FPS (this is capped for my monitor).

,"Primero comenzaré con el envío:
Pedí ésto a casi mediados de septiembre y tenía fecha de llegada para el 1 de octubre pagando el envío más caro (en ese tiempo se demoraba entre 3 a 5 días hábiles). Al llegar a la fecha de entrega, me aparece una notificación de ""llegará hoy"", pero el producto ni siquiera tenía estado ""enviado"". Al día siguiente, me avisan por correo y decían que el producto ya no tenía una fecha determinada de envío y que me notificarían apenas estuviera. Entre tanto trámite, me terminó llegando casi a finales de octubre con casi 1 mes y medio de demora desde el momento en que fue comprado CON EL ENVÍO MÁS RÁPIDO.
Después de toda esta situación, vi que amazon cambió los precios y tiempos de despacho para los envíos (y el más caro ahora es bastante barato). Todo esto es la razón por la que doy 4 y no 5 estrellas.

Ahora el producto:

Muy bueno. Llegó en muy buen estado y no tuve ningún problema hasta el momento, siendo la primera vez que armo una computadora.
Pedí la versión con gráficos integrados mientras compro una GPU y no me arrepiento, a pesar de que las integradas de intel tengan un poco de mala fama, me ha servido para jugar en ultra en algunos juegos y estoy totalmente satisfecho.

,"I bought this because it was slight cheaper as an Amazon used item, and in stock as currently the new intel 9th Gen are really in demand. Overclocked to 5Ghz on 2 cores, 4.8 on 4, 4.6 on all cores with no voltage increase, just left on auto. Seems to be at 1.24v. Runs relatively cool on an old Evo 212 cheap tower cooler. It is a hackintosh so being thermally limited is what Apple would do! LoL. I'm sure Prime95 AVX would cook it in seconds, but normal software doesn't seem to be a problem. Overclocking is playing the lottery, but the solder used to attach the heat spreader in these new chips is worth getting the 9th ben over the previous crap intel has been selling. My previous CPU, a 3770K did not cool as fast as this thing, having the thermal past instead of solder really does make a difference. In Intel Powe gadget when you shut down Prime95 there is a cliff on the termperture chart that is immediate. The temperature drop is so sudden I worry about things cracking.

The Intel Power Gadget reports about 130 watts with all cores using Prime95 without AVX. The 95 watt TDP is BS, you will have to go in the BIOS and change the 95 in about half a zone places, annoying. Don't overlook changing the max current too. If you are not getting the speeds you think you should, that is probably what is wrong.

,"Ho avuto per mesi il Ryzen 7 2700x ma dopo vari problemi irrisolvibili ho detto basta.
I problemi riguardavano dei freeze durante le sessioni di gioco e un fastidiosissimo popping audio che non sono riuscito in nessun modo a risolvere. Non sono di certo un hater o di parte, il Ryzen aveva un rapporto qualità/prezzo migliori di Intel alla sua uscita e visto che in quel momento mi serviva un processore l'ho comprato.
Posso dire di aver provato in tutti i modi a risolvere i problemi, ho cambiato tutti i componenti del pc e solo alla fine ho anche cambiato il processore prendendone uno identico senza praticamente risolvere nulla.
Passato quindi a questo i5 9600k e perdendo quindi i due core e non solo, magicamente tutti i problemi si sono risolti.
Posso confermare che non è un problema di scheda madre, ovviamente passato a Intel ho dovuto cambiare anche quella, cosa che avevo fatto anche con la X470 senza risolvere.
Sulle prestazioni non ho visto poi molta differenza, in gioco il Ryzen stock era fisso intorno ai 4.100 sia con dissipatore ad aria che con un AIO (il dissipatore stock mi si è rotto due mesi dopo l'utilizzo) mentre questo i5 9600k stock è fisso a 4.295 per la storia che a 4.6 arriva solo su un core.

,"Processore veloce, molto performante, non scalda troppo e dà grandi soddisfazioni.
Mi sono preso qualche mese per testarlo adeguatamente e posso affermare di essere davvero molto contento dell'acquisto: multitasking pesante, fotoritocco e rendering non lo mettono mai in difficoltà.
Non sono uno che con il pc ci gioca ma quello che leggo in giro ne parlano davvero bene.

Acquistato quando il prezzo si aggirava intorno ai 320 euro l'ho inserito in una configurazione con scheda madre dotata di chipset Z390, GSkill Rgb Trident Z e raffreddamento ad aria Noctua U14S.
Montato inizialmente su una Asus Z390 (che poi ho regalato ad un amico per usi più tranquilli), mi sono accorto che era la scheda madre ad impedirgli di esprimere appieno le sue potenzialità. Scelta una motherboard di altra marca (sempre con chipset Z390) è letteralmente decollato. L'ho tenuto a 5250 Mhz per una decina di giorni, rock solid, mai una piega anche con attività impegnative (ho poi optato per abbassare un po' la frequenza massima tanto nel daily use non c'è bisogno di tutta questa potenza).

Se avete bisogno di una cpu altamente performante per lavoro, per gioco o se siete amanti dell'overclock, l'Intel 9600K abbinato ad una buona scheda madre, con un valido sistema di raffreddamento ed un'adeguata alimentazione si rivelerà un'ottima scelta su piattaforma Intel.",Verified Purchase,Michele A.,Reviewed in Italy on 16 February 2019,True,[]
,"Da ich einen neuen Computer zusammenstellen wollte, fiel meine Wahl relativ schnell auf den Intel Core i5, da ich wirklich nur ein Mittelklasse System wollte, und ich bisher nie große Probleme mit Intel Prozessoren hatte. Mir ist es durchaus Bewusst gewesen dass es mit der AMD Ryzen Familie eine ernstzunehmende Alternative gibt (zumindest mti dem Ryzen 5 3600 habe ich mich auch beschäftigt), jedoch habe ich mich doch wieder für einen Intel Prozessor entschieden. (Letztendlich wäre es vermutlich aber auch egal gewesen für welchen Prozessor ich mich entscheide)

Beim Preisvergleich auf Amazon ist mir dann relativ schnell aufgefallen dass der i5 9600K Preislich nicht allzusehr von dem i5 9500, welchen ich ursprünglich verwenden wollte abgewichen ist. (War wenn ich mich recht erinnere zum Zeitpunkt des Kaufs sogar der i5-9600K günstiger). Deswegen hab ich dann diesen Prozessor gewählt.

Die Installation im Mainboard klappte ohne Probleme, ich habe dann nur meine Wahl auf das Asus Z390-P angepasst, da ich nicht zwangsläufig übertakten möchte, mir die Möglichkeit moderat zu übertakten offenhalten wollte.

Wichtig zu wissen ist nur dass in der BOXED Version der Prozessoren mit dem K im Namen kein Kühler integriert ist (da ich nicht so häufig Prozessoren kaufe ist mir diese Info Anfangs entgangen, was aber auch nicht schlimm ist, weil man für ca. 25€ schon Kühler findet welche ganz okay sind)

The efficiency and speed are especially evident in CPU-intensive tasks, where this processor clearly outshines its predecessor.

Beyond just raw performance, what I appreciate about the Intel Core i5-13600KF is its balance between power and efficiency. The division of Performance-cores and Efficiency-cores means that it smartly allocates resources based on the task at hand, ensuring optimal performance without unnecessary power consumption. This aspect is crucial for a balanced system that's powerful yet not overly taxing on energy use. The upgrade process itself was straightforward, and the compatibility with a wide range of motherboards and hardware made the transition smooth. In terms of gaming, the difference is palpable, with smoother frame rates and faster loading times. For creative tasks like video editing and 3D rendering, the performance boost has been equally beneficial, noticeably reducing the time spent on rendering and processing. All in all, the Intel Core i5-13600KF has proven to be an excellent upgrade from the Ryzen 5800X3D, offering a superb blend of performance, efficiency, and versatility.

,"I won't go into much technical detail here since there's people a lot smarter than myself who can get into the nitty gritty. Generally speaking though - this CPU absolutely smokes, especially for the price. Don't let the 'i5' name fool you. The i5-13600K (and KF) is a top-class processor that for most users, will offer more than enough performance for intensive tasks while having probably the most reasonable power consumption and cooling requirements of the top-three 13th generation Intel processors.

I came from an i7-5960X - still a solid processor in this day and age but unfortunately my motherboard wasn't exactly kind to me attempting to take it above 3.8 GHz. Despite it bottlenecking against my 2080 Ti, it still ran cool under a 360mm CLC, topping out at no more than 51 degrees C gaming (GPU load) and 60 degrees under full CPU loads. But since the current market for new components is pretty good, I opted to go all in on a 13th gen build rather than find a better X99 motherboard.

Odds are, you're probably going to be cross shopping the i5-13600K with the i7-13700K and the i9-13900K. Unless your workflow necessitates the additional core count or you're chasing records, the performance difference between those CPUs and the 13600K did not seem worth the hundreds of dollars of additional cost and the massive increase in peak power consumption. Power also equals heat, and that was another motivating factor for going with the 13600K, having been accustomed to a relatively cool and quiet build for some time. That said; with the additional cores and much higher boost frequency, I was expecting higher peak power draw and temps despite a lower TDP on paper.

And they were definitely higher, under the same 360mm CLC. After running benchmarks with Cinebench and 3DMark, I was hitting peak temps in the mid-to-high 70s under full CPU loads. Gaming loads however were definitely more manageable though, sitting in the 40s and seldom breaking 50 degrees, which was actually a small but appreciable improvement over the 5960X. I'd advise at minimum a high quality air cooler or a 240mm CLC for this processor.

The out of the box performance is something else though. I managed to hit 23345 on a multi-core Cinebench test and a 16459 combined score on 3DMark Time Spy. Again, this is stock clocks paired with an overclocked 2080 Ti and 32GB of DDR5 at 5600 MHz. At 3440 x 1440 and 144Hz, games run like butter. I could dabble in overclocking it since I have the headroom but honestly, I don't see the point. It's fantastic as is.

All in all, I feel like the 13600K is kind of the no-brainer option for most people looking to put together a high-end system on a budget. You're getting most of the performance of it's more expensive stablemates for a much lower price and less obnoxiously high power and cooling requirements. The KF is also a little cheaper if you don't need integrated graphics. Just buy it. You'll love it.",Verified Purchase,YALE70,Reviewed in the United States on 22 February 2023,True,[]

,"I was on the fence about upgrading from i5 12400f, which is a beast of a cpu. Some pros and cons. My specs: RTX 4070ti, z790 ddr5 gigabyte mobo, 32 gb fury ram, 1tb WD black SSD gen 4.

Pros:
More cores
Noticeably faster in some areas like booting and some applications.
Some triple A GPU bound games will get a noticeable FPS boost. (Not huge, talking 3-10 at most).
CPU bound games (emulators for me) will get much better stability and cpu usage reduction.

Cons:
If you are looking for energy efficiency these 13th gen and higher chips are NOT it. More cores means more energy draw for sure. On Triple A games the chip is using 20-30 watts more electricity. In emulators like RPCS3 it’s nearly double. I went from 30- 40 watt average to average 80 and in some instances spiked above 100. The good thing is emulators are much less GPU bound so the wattage balances out, sort of.

Heat- I’m running an AIO lian li 360 Galahad, with the 12400f I was nearly always running at room temp (my house gets lots of shade and stays cool/cold) so I was used to 22c range. With the 13600k you will see a 10 degree increase even at idle. Emulators will get into the 60s while triple A games 40s and 50s. With the 12400f my fan curve rarely ever triggered high fan speeds. With the 13th gen you will definitely hear those fans work at load.

Side notes I tried the 13600k on two mobos (z790 and 690) you can use it on older 690 compatible mobos, you just need to flash bios to latest. It was super easy on the gigabyte z790 and 690 mobo.

Overall. The performance jump is noticeable in some games. But far more noticeable is the increase in heat and wattage usage. If you have a 12th gen and are on the fence you really don’t need to upgrade, however depending on what you are doing with it could be the main factor. I wanted my RPCS3 to run at 60fps in 4k constantly and the 13600k did the trick.

boot time, and app loading is measurably quicker. when stress/load tested using the intel tool, it gets very hot. with this processor, temps above 89c did not cause throttling, so intel must be ok with this. temps are considerably lower when not testing. i was ready to buy an aio cooler but am holding off for now. the huge noctua d15 attached may suffice. i don't want to mess around with water pumps, so until intel figures out how to bring the heat, with less heat, i can park here for the foreseeable.

I didn't do any in-depth comparisons for cost to speed, etc. as I felt it unnecessary. I'm coming from a 2014 Intel i7, so pretty much anything is going to be an upgrade. Everything is working great. Air-cooled with a deepcool AK620, the temps under prime95 load can reach 100c, which seems extremely hot, but it seems like that's just the way the cookie crumbles with my setup. Reapplied thermal paste and made some space in my tower for better airflow and it more or less remained the same. Idle temps are around 35c.

,"Questo processore non ha bisogno di particolari presentazioni, su internet sono presenti i benchmark e le recensioni di utenti molto più esperti, Racconterò quindi la mia esperienza di utilizzo. Ho assemblato il PC con questo processore da più di un mese ormai e non ho mai avuto problemi, il dissipatore stock (grazie anche al case) fa un ottimo lavoro per un utilizzo normale ed anche sotto sforzo. La grafica inclusa è più che sufficiente per un utilizzo quotidiano ed un gaming leggero con una grafica, ovviamente, non full hd e con quale micro lag ogni tanto su giochi pesanti. Un paio di giorni fa ho giocato a più di un'ora a forza motorsport 6 (tra i requisiti minimi ha la presenza di una scheda video dedicata di 2GB, assente nel mio computer) e controllando le temperature non superavo i 28°. Ovviamente durante l'uso di giochi del genere, il PC subisce un leggero rallentamento. Lo uso inoltre per QGis, un programma che richiede comunque una buona risposta da parte del computer e quando mi trovo a compilare algoritmi, il processore li elabora in pochissimo tempo. Esistono processori sicuramente più potenti, ma comprando questo processore consci del suo valore economico e prestazionale, non si può non dargli 5 stelle, proprio perché soddisfa appieno ciò che promette.

,"Oggetto comprato per assemblare un pc da gaming di medio livello.
Nello specifico il sistema prevede:
- Intel Core i5-7400 3GHz 6MB
- Asrock B250M Pro 4 mATX
- ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1060 6GB AMP! Edition
- Corsair Vengeance LPX 8 GB
- Samsung SSD 850 EVO 250 GB

Il dissipatore stock non è dei migliori; difatti dopo 1 mese di utilizzo sotto stress comincia a far sentire l'uso di materiali di scarsa qualità.
Ho scelto una scheda madre microATX perchè l'idea è di montare in tutto, in futuro, in un case microATX.
La scheda video riesce a garantire prestazioni eccezionali e riesce, insieme alla cpu da me scelta, di far girare al massimo dei dettagli videogame come LA Noire, GTA 5 Online, Resident Evil 7, Ghost Recon Wildlands, Fifa 18.

Riesce tranquillamente ad interfacciarsi benissimo con schede video come la 1060, 1050Ti e anche rx 480 e 580.
Le temperature con il dissipatore e la pasta termica fornita con esso sono molto buone, anche dopo un utilizzo prolungato sotto stress non si superano mai i 46-47 gradi e con un dissipatore aftermarket si riesce a fare anche di meglio (sempre che lo stesso valga più di 15-20€, al disotto di questa soglia non vale la pena di sostituire il dissipatore stock).
Non teme particolarmente il confronto con Ryzen 5 anche perché per un utilizzo gaming l'hyper-trading di Ryzen 5 risulta poco sfruttabile e non dimentichiamoci che questo i5 è dotato di scheda video integrata al contrario di Ryzen 5, rendendolo utilizzabile anche senza una GPU esterna.

,"サブ機のCPUに以前はi5-10400を使用していました。CPUは性能的には満足していたのですが、記憶ディスクがS-ATA接続のSSDで、ファイルの読み書きの性能を上げたくなりました。ところが、自分が使っていたマザーボードだと、NVMe M.2 PCIe接続のGen 4.0×4 のSSDに換装するには、CPUがIntel10世代だとGen 3.0までしか対応していないため、CPUを11世代に上げることにしました。

CPU性能とファイルのアクセス性能とのバランスがとれた良い構成になったなあと、一旦は思ったのですが、そうなると欲が出るもので、Windowsを10から11に上げることにしました。メインのほうのPCだと、あまり実験的なことができないもので。
アプリを一からインストールするのが手間だったので、Windows10の環境を引き継ぐ形で11に上げたのですが、すると、Windowsを起動するだけで、CPUの負荷が全開になりっぱなしに。あわてて、11のクリーンインストールからやりなおすと、CPUの負荷がすっかり落ち着きました。むしろ自分にはオーバークオリティなぐらいです。

その後、CPUに全負荷をかけ続けるソフトを走らせて試したところ、室温15度の状態で、CPUのコアの温度が75度まで上がりました。i5-10400よりも高い感じです。夏の気温が高い状態でどうなるか、ちょっと心配です。

あと、Linux(ubuntu)をインストールしたら、起動直後に「VMX disabled by BIOS」という画面が一瞬表示されるようになったので、BIOSの画面を開いてみたら、CPUの詳細設定で「Intel(R) Virtualization Technology」の項目が「Disabled」になっていたので、「Enabled」へと設定を変更したら、警告メッセージは出なくなりましたが、体感上の違いはないので、どこが良くなったのか、よくはわかりませんでした。",Verified Purchase,へっぽこぷー太,Reviewed in Japan on 24 January 2024,True,[]

,"Processeur avec un bon rapport performance/prix.

ただ、虎徹mark2を使用していますがPCケースの排熱がr53600に比べて11400Fの方が暑い気がします

10400Fと11400Fと迷いましたが、コスパを選ぶのなら10400Fの方が安いですしそちらの方をオススメですかね

,"Processore Intel 11ma generazione, 6 core. Il dissipatore con cui viene venduto è abbastanza silenzioso e fa il suo lavoro.

,"Core i5-4590からの乗り換えです。
ベンチマーク走らせたり最高負荷で動かしたことはないので通常使用でのレビューとなります。

今回は以下のような構成で組んでみました。

CPU: Core i7-10700K
MB: ASUS TUF GAMING Z490 PLUS
Cooler: 風魔 弐（FUMA2）
グリス: SMZ-01R
GPU: MSI GeForce GTX 1070 ARMOR 8G OC (4590からの移設)
MEM: ADATA DDR4-2666 16GB x 2
SSD: WD Blue SN550 1TB NVMe
電源: Cobra Power 800W

[総評]
ゲームにおいても開発作業においても十分以上の性能を発揮してくれます。
価格も購入当初は56,000円と高めでしたが、最近49,000円くらいまで落ち着いてきたみたいなので、今から組むのなら10700K一択ですね。
Comet Lake-Sよりハイパースレッディングテクノロジーが解禁されたためわざわざ数千～1万渋ってまでCoffee Lake以前のi7を買う意味があまり感じられないのが正直なところ。
値段的な意味でしぶるならi5-10600Kを視野にいれるほうがコスパはいいと思います。

[処理性能]
ゲーム性能はGPU性能がものを言いますが、タイトルによってはCPUもかなり食うので性能が低いとボトルネックとなることがあります。
4590ではGTA Vの中画質程度でCPU 100%張り付きで大体40-60FPSを行き来していたのが10700Kでは60FPSを常に維持できました。
Dying Lightもやりましたが、常に60FPS維持できた上に使用率は20%行ってたかな？程度。(GTA Vも含めて)
CPUに余裕があれば複数のゲームを同時起動することも可能なので、ネトゲしながらGTA Vやったりなんてことも性能的には余裕です。
検証した時もマビノギを付けながらやっていたのでゲーム単体ならもっと余裕があります。

あとはVisual Studio + Resharperによる開発も行っていますが、起動は数秒程度でビルドも数秒で終わります。
4590時代は起動だけで数分放置していたくらいなのでこの差は大きいですね。
当時はHDDだったのでSSDに変わったのも大きいとは思いますが。

また内蔵のUHD Graphics 630でもしばらくゲームをしていましたが、マビノギ程度の軽いゲームなら画質下と中の間くらいの設定でも60FPS維持できていました。
GTA Vなどのグラフィックに重きを置いたゲームなどは20-30FPS程度しかでないようなのでやっぱりそれなりのGPUは欲しいです。

[排熱]
評価項目に暖かさとかいうよくわからない項目がありましたが、排熱としてレビューします。
TDP125Wと前代の95W(4590はさらに低い65W)よりも上がりましたが、通常使用においては4590と比較してもさほど変わりはないかなと。
アイドリングは大体30-35度程度、ゲーム時は40-55度程度をうろうろしています。
なので、ゲーム程度なら空冷でも問題ないですし、そこまで構える必要はないかな。
ただ、負荷が増すとやっぱり熱は出ますので120mm以上のクーラーは欲しいですね。

[安定性]
処理性能でも述べましたが、基本的に余裕がある状態が常なので安定性は抜群です。
今のところCPUに起因したトラブルは一切ないです。

電力消費に関してもTDP125Wに上がったとはいえゲーム程度なら行って50W程度なのでそこまで消費しないかなと。
4590と比較してもそんな大差はなさそう。
もちろん負荷が少ない状態での話なのでさらに増すと消費電力はもっと上がります。
ベンチマークで230Wくらいいってるレビューも見かけたので電源の選択は余裕をもっておくといいでしょう。
Z490マザボだとCPU電源が8 + 4pin(一部メーカーはH470も)なので、願わくばCPUコネクタ 4 + 4pin x 2があるものを選びたいところ。

[互換性]
Comet Lake-SからソケットがLGA1200と一新されたため、前代のLGA1151とは互換性がありません。
買い替えを検討している方はMBの買い替えも必要なので注意しましょう。

なお、クーラーに関してはLGA1151と取り付け位置が同じなので基本的にLGA1151のクーラーが使えます。
風魔 弐（FUMA2）は公式でも装着可能とのことなので検討中の方はご安心を。
一応購入後のマニュアルではLGA1200がシレッっと追加されていたので公式にサポートしたのかな？",Verified Purchase,sztk,Reviewed in Japan on 14 July 2020,True,[]

,"Don’t let the 125w TDP fool ya because this chip runs WAY cooler than previous gens. Tested temps using OCCT stress test for about 3 hours, alongside my Noctua NH-D15 cooler. The highest I’ve seen the temp spike up to was 71c. Note that OCCT is a heavy synthetic test that pushes the CPU to the limit. Regular gaming temps will never reach that high. I’ve had the chip for almost two months now and accumulated quite a bit of gaming hours during that time. The games I played included a mix of intensive AAA titles like CoD Warzone and AC: Odyssey to light eSport ones such as Rocket League and Rainbow Six Siege. Highest temps are always in the 50s to mid 60s range. That is a huge difference compared to my old i5 6600k that spiked to over 80c at times! My brother who bought a 9900k last year was also amazed by how much cooler 10th gen runs and even said that he wished he waited a bit longer before upgrading. Note that both the 9900k and 6600k have lower TDPs than the 10700k yet still run warmer. The reason as to why 10th gen runs cooler is because intel made modifications to the IHS of the cpu and upgraded their Thermal Interface Material. Other then the improvement in the temperature department, I’ve also noticed a big difference in gaming performance. Despite having a 2080 super, my PC used to struggle to reach and stay at a consistent 100+fps at 1080p. CPU intensive games like AC Odyssey often dropped to like 50fps. This is a clear indication that there was bottleneck on the CPU side. With this new 10700k, My PC now has no problems reaching and maintaining that sweet consistent 144+ FPS on light competitive eSport titles and 100+FPS on demanding CPU intensive AAA titles. Also, note that I am running the CPU at stock settings right out the box and have not messed with overclocking yet.

,"Works great, the original one I got from Amazon died on me within 2 weeks it was essentially dead on arrival. This rarely happens but from time to time this can happen.

I contacted Intel and asked for a replacement and they agreed as it was under warranty obviously. While I had to pay like $10 to ship it to them which I originally thought was sorta cheap since other companies like MSI cover the shipping costs I can see why Intel doesn't.

While I only paid $10 for shipping I assumed it would be ground shipping from Canada to the middle of the USA and figured I'd be without a CPU for up to 2-weeks.

Turns out Intel ships via Air and my package was on a Plane and arrived at the facility within 8 hours and I had a new CPU in my computer within 72 hours.

I would highly recommend this product even after my issues because Intel was as fast as possible with replacing mine.

After using this product for a few months it's worked great and performs perfectly and I've had no issues since getting the original replaced.",Verified Purchase,Rrezz,Reviewed in Canada on 18 January 2022,True,[]
,"I waited too long to switch back to the FPS king. This chip is amazing. I missed you Intel.

The PC world is weird. Always chasing $50 savings. Too many games have CPU bottlenecks. I debated hard between just buying a 3700x to replace my 2700x versus the hard MB/CPU upgrade to Intel. But AMD had left me frustrated. My 2700x was never maxed out and I couldn’t tell what was bottleknecking me. The 3700x didn’t promise much higher clock speeds so I wasn’t sure if an upgrade would help. I play Rust on 1440p and my GPU and CPU would sit at 60% utilization or less with frames only around 70fps. First test with the 10700k stock and I’m at 135fps, max graphic settings. My GPU is now pumping out 99% utilization and the game feels amazing.

This chip runs cool on stock. Idk where all the bad thermal predictions came from, but it didn’t happen. Haven’t even OC’d it yet and honestly I may not need to until I upgrade off of my 2080super. But that’s not happening any time soon. I’m hitting 144fps on 1440p max settings now in every FPS game and that was the goal.

Thank you Intel, you nailed this one. The 9th gen had some cost/heat issues and that made me give AMD a try and I’m glad to be back!

For anyone choosing a card. The 10700k is the sweet spot for gaming and streaming. If you only game, I think the 10600k is a cheaper but same performance. I don’t see any need for the 10900k.",Verified Purchase,Michael,Reviewed in the United States on 5 June 2020,True,[]

,"(a) Considering its current price and given that its gaming performance (without power limits) is overall identical to the 11700k (without power limits too) and just 3-4% slower overall than the 5800x I would say this cpu is the best choice for gaming. After overclocking it actually beats or matches the 5800x overall even when compared against a PBOed 5800x. By ""overall"" I mean when comparing these cpus in a large range of games (30+ games) and not just 4-5, (something that some biased reviews do)

(b) Productivity is very good too although in heavy multithreaded applications (e.g. tile-based rendering) it does lose by 10-20% to both the 11700k and the 5800x. That said it reduces the deficit to only 3-15% in an overclocked vs overclocked battle, thanks to its higher overclocking potential.

(c) It runs pretty cool - I am using a Noctua NH-D15 and is also very silent. Even on stock auto motherboard settings (and with power limits removed) I don't get temps above 68-69C even when running Cinebench R23 in a loop and sustaining indefinitely the stock all-core 4.7GHz. Temps reduce further when you manually tune the voltage to a lower value (a practice known as undervolting) or when you apply a better thermal paste or a case with better airflow. You can also undervolt and still overclock. Or overclock more without increasing the voltage above its stock value.

(d) I paired it with a fairly high-end Asus Z490 (Strix-E) board instead of a Z590 one. There is no reason buying a Z590 board for 10th gen cpus as for the same price you typically don't get ""enthusiast"" features (such as postcode, third PCIe x16 slot, PCIe bifurcation, etc). Moreover most of the ""goodies"" of the Z590 boards (e.g. PCIe4, additional M.2 slot, DMI3x8) are only enabled when using an 11th gen cpu. So buying a Z590 for 10th gen is a bit of a waste.

(e) Currently the price of the 11700K +Z590 is around 200 euros higher than that of the 10700K+Z490 combo. If the difference drops to 60-80 euros then I would advise to go for the former instead.

,"Yeah I know, Ryzens are cheaper, and out perform the Intel chips in everything... except clocks. As a gamer, I want the highest single core speed possible, 16 threads instead of 32? Whatever, I don't need that many for my uses, lol.

I don't upgrade often, and until now I was still running my trusty 4790k, which still can hold it's own pretty well, but now with the 10700k, the 1080 isn't bottlenecked by my CPU any more, and it's VERY noticeable in certain games I normally saw slight issues.

Should you upgrade 9th gen, or even 8th gen to 10th gen? Honestly, probably not. But if you're say, a few of more generations behind now, it's a worthy upgrade. Yes it's an upgraded 9900k, but that's still really good for ~$400!

a) it was in stock
b) I had the budget for it
c) I trust intel more than AMD Ryzen even though AMD Ryzen is considered now as the better hardware (judging by per-core performance). I have always thought Intel's drivers are better, I have also heard recent reports that Ryzen CPUs usage can randomly go up by 20% with just the epic games store running. I can imagine this will be fixed as it sounds more like some dodgy code than the hardware itself.

On every game I have played, I don't think the CPU usage has gone above 40%. So this CPU will definitely last a LONG time before I upgrade.

,"I've had my 10700K for about a month now. I paired it with a brand new Asus Maximus XII Extreme and kept my 2080 ROG Strix. The three make a beautiful pairing. If you aren't planning on overclocking, I'll just say, pick this up and you won't regret it. If you aren't speed-chasing, it isn't worth the extra money of going to the 10900K. If you are overclocking, I personally believe the money-performance ratio puts the 10700K on top. But, speed-chasing would suggest picking up the 10900K.
As expected, temps are a little hot when overclocking. I used XMP I, clocked to 5.1GHz and left voltage on adaptive. My mobo thinks it's a good idea to stick a whopping 1.545v into it to support 5.1GHz and hit over 100C (exact temp unknown, neither of my monitoring programs read hotter than 100C), but that's totally unnecessary. Dropping down to 1.46v, highest temp spike during stress test hit 90C, not a degree warmer (25min stress test using Cinebench, 360mm ROG AIO). My goal is to hit 5.2GHz this evening. If I have the ability to update reviews, I will post results.

,"While a good idea anyway, with many processors now utilizing stock overclocks, you can benefit a performance boost by choosing a better CPU cooler. I went the cheap route, actually, I thought it was middle of the road since the Thermaltake Contac Silent 12 is rated for 150w. I thought I could get away with a $30 cooler since I am not planning on overclocking. That cooler could not even keep up with stock CPU settings. In benchmarks the CPU hit 80-Celsius in seconds and gradually up to 90 where I had it set to throttle. In more practical testing, under basic workloads the temps are more reasonable but the Contac Silent 12 has to ramp up to %100 fan speed frequently to keep that way and it is not quiet at that speed. I know somebody is going to say that's because the default settings on the motherboard are overclocking the CPU beyond Intel's recommended settings. Well, that was one of the first things I checked and that's not the case here. Despite what somebody on YouTube said or didn't say, not all motherboards do that. It is a great processor and complements my workload nicely (no games here). The new cooler is a Reeven Justice, $45 right now. I has the same size 120mm fan however it has six heat pipes instead of four and the tower is about %50 thicker and fins stacked closer together. Temps, while still pretty hot, have come down 8-10 degrees on Cinebench R-20. It still gets up to 80-82 Celsius but instead of hitting 80 right away as it did before, it takes until the render is almost complete and seems to level off there. I feel better about the temps now that It's not riding on the ceiling, especially since all core full load is not a typical workload for me. The fan is much quieter during typical use. I would recommend that cooler for those who are looking for a good compatible cooler.",Verified Purchase,Fuzz,Reviewed in the United States on 10 June 2020,True,[]

2 Samsung 860s and 1 M.2 870 (I'd recommend picking up an M.2 if you go with gigabytes now motherboards.. theyre putting 2-4 slots on their MBs now so I feel like it's just untapped potential if you're not going to be using at least one of those slots)
Power- EVGA 750w (80+ gold I think?)
Case - I did have everything in an NZXT S340, but I just moved it all into that new Corsair mesh case that came out (TD500 Mesh) and airflow and aesthetics are superb.",Verified Purchase,Ian,Reviewed in the United States on 10 June 2020,True,[]

,"Paired with a ASUS ROG Strix Z490-E Gaming board I was able to easily and quickly achieve a 5.0Ghz all core overclock on air cooling. It's rock solid stable with XMP profile on the RAM and a small cache overclock. This thing absolutely crushes my previous i7-7000k CPU and I noticed a big difference in FPS in quite a few games.

I think I may have gotten lucky on the silicon with this chip. I can hit 5.1Ghz stable but it does start to get a little too hot for my comfort, but i actually dont start thermal throttling until I try 5.2Ghz all core. Again, this is just on air using a Noctua DH-D15 so its possible I could do more with an AIO cooler. With enough cooling and time spent tweaking this chip may very well hit 5.2Ghz all core and remain stable. I'll update the review if i ever give that a shot.

Its expensive of course.. because it's intel. But if Intel is your jam.. you cant go wrong here.",Verified Purchase,Eric K. Johnson,Reviewed in the United States on 29 June 2020,True,[]
,"Got the CPU on prime day for sale. I didn't actually need the K variant because I don't plan on overclocking but it was actually cheaper than the F variant during the sale. So far it's been working wonderfully, with no issues and I saved $127. Big upgrade from an i5-4570. For gaming purposes this chip is probably a little overkill but it was so cheap I couldn't pass it up. However since I had to change the mother board and all it's components for it, which all weren't on sale, I still ended up spending $670 for this chip. Debatable if it was really worth it but I'm happy with the performance.",Verified Purchase,Michelle,Reviewed in the United States on 8 October 2021,True,[]
,"Zero issues installing and running it on a Gigabyte Vision G motherboard. Using a relatively cheap Enermax 120mm Liquid Cooler, and not overclocked, the CPU idles around 30 deg C, and under full load, I have yet to have it go over 55. Using a mid tower Antec case with lots of airflow too. Of course, anyone who is buying just a CPU, is probably fully aware of what cooling issues they may or may not run into. Included my info just to help. I got mine on sale, but even at sale prices, Intel are never cheap. I have never had an issue with any Intel CPU I have used. And, if this CPU holds up like my old I7-3770K did, I won't have to upgrade again for several years. Happy with the purchase.",Verified Purchase,Roy A,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2021,True,[]
,"I like the delivery being truly fast. I messed up on the payment info and wasn't able to get it the same day like promised but Amazon got it to me the next morning instead. So, that was nice and I appreciated the fact that they got it to me as fast as possible even though they probably could have just said, ""No, you didn't pay properly, so no same day shipping."" So, that was nice. I will construct my PC once my motherboard comes in, In Sha Allah so we will see if the processor is good.",Verified Purchase,Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 26 February 2022,True,[]
,"I know this chip is on its way out, but if you're looking at this and the price is right, it's a good CPU. With a Be Quiet! cooler my temps are good even under constant load. One thing Intel does that puts AMD to shame is the integrated graphics. Especially right now when there are no graphics cards, this will get you a working desktop. I intended to upgrade to a Ryzen 5800X from my Ryzen 3600 later this year, but my GTX 1070Ti died and I was left with a broken desktop. I opted to get this so I could work, even if I couldn't play and the intel graphics makes the perfect fallback. Heck, I could even play Factorio and Portal on my 3440x1440 monitor",Verified Purchase,AwwD,Reviewed in the United States on 26 April 2021,True,[]

,I have been a computer Enthusiast for a while now. I have owned several different platforms including both AMD and INTEL. I upgraded from a i7 7700k. The 7700k’s 4 cores and 8 threads started to show its age with the recent push for higher core counts. I debated getting an AMD 3900x. The appeal of 10 cores and 20 threads was great and but at the sacrifice of core clocks. I am a gamer at heart and do little video/photo editing. The decision was made in my mind and I purchased the 10700k. Out of the box the 10700k boost to 5.1ghz. Yes 5.1ghz insanity. While Intel is still on a 14 nano meter architecture compared to AMD’s 7 Intel has refined the process to undoubtedly still beat AMD in gaming. I have no complaints about the 10700k. It is satisfying to know I won’t need to upgrade for years now.,Verified Purchase,Jonah mann,Reviewed in the United States on 3 August 2020,True,[]
,"I bought this along with the MSI Z490 Unify as an upgrade from my Ryzen 7 3700X. This thing is an absolute monster that runs any game I throw at it at 144fps if my gpu can keep up. It's crazy. People told me I wouldn't see many gains coming from Ryzen but in some of my favorite games I was getting 60%+ higher framerates. Games perform amazingly well and I notice my loading screens all seem about 20% faster than my old chip as well. Everything is just smoother and faster, there's less waiting time, and I didn't have any bios issues or anything at all. Installation was easy. Honestly this is probably overkill unless you have a nice RTX graphics card but it's a wonderful CPU. The temps aren't too crazy with a 280mm aio. I think I'll be happy with this chip for the next 5 years+ at least.",Verified Purchase,Austin,Reviewed in the United States on 9 July 2020,True,[]

,"Installation went smooth using this 10700k in a rig with a 2060 super and it is crushing fps numbers. I mainly play fast paced shooters and want as many frames as possible and this thing does not disappoint. Came from a ryzen 3770x. Valorant and CSGO frames are very high, and i never get any slow downs or mouse input delay it feels great!

Also a lot of people said this new intel gen ran very hot and i don't even hit above 65c at full load having it overclocked to 5.2ghz. Now i do have one of the best AIR coolers out there so even if you have a cooler that is not as good you are looking at safe and normal temps even when overclocked to 5.2 ghz.",Verified Purchase,Rob,Reviewed in the United States on 14 July 2020,True,[]
,"I love this processor, granted its a huge upgrade over what I had previously but even with that in mind I still think this is an impressive unit. The base clock of 3.8 is pretty fast already but under load with no tweaking it would reach and maintain 4.6 no problem and with windows performance power profiles it reaches 5.0 with ease, and that's with no overclocking. Buyer beware this thing makes some heat so get yourself a good heatsink or deal with it underclocking a lot to keep temps under control.",Verified Purchase,thomas brandon,Reviewed in the United States on 28 June 2021,True,[]
,"I just got into PC building, there are so many chipsets on the market after 100's of hours watching everyone's favorite youtubers I learned one thing....... A lot of chips fit the specs for what you need lol. i am extremely happy with this chip, coupled with my Asus mother board overclocking this thing was a breeze. as far as temps when overclocking, I'm able to keep this cool with a pretty standard CPU fan, no need to water-cool, although the look of it is awesome",Verified Purchase,Neko,Reviewed in the United States on 31 July 2021,True,[]
,"put in an MSI Z470 sli , just finished so don't know about the gaming yet, just know it runs super-fast and super cool, water cooled with a corsair 280mm radiator. Of course, it is freezing in this room and we all should know, it can never be cooler than the air around it.",Verified Purchase,John R Haynes,Reviewed in the United States on 25 June 2022,True,[]
,I bought this to upgrade my gaming pc and without even running a gaming app I can already tell the speed is much better than my i7-6700k. Things that would require 50% of my processor utilization take less that 10% on my cpu load. Only big down side is you have to get a new motherboard for this type of socket LGA1200 or something and it requires more power from your supply so make sure you have the equipment necessary before buying,Verified Purchase,A warrior,Reviewed in the United States on 1 July 2021,True,[]
,"The i7-10700k is a fantastic CPU for the money. I upgraded from a i5-4690 (locked, non-K) and can immediately tell a difference in a lot of games I play. My GPU (EVGA RTX 2060) is not bottlenecked by the CPU anymore. Don't believe all the things you read about Intel 10th gen chips running hot either. I have this installed in an ITX case with a Noctua air cooler and idle temps are between 28-31C. Load temps don't go above 60C. It also reaches 5.1GHZ out of the box, no overclocking needed.",Verified Purchase,philbobagginzz,Reviewed in the United States on 28 March 2021,True,[]
,"Got this cpu as an upgrade from a i7 7700 during 2021, it has been a huge upgrade for gaming.
